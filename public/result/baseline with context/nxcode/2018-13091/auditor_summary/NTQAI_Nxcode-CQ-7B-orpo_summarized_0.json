            "reason": "The vulnerability exists in the line `balanceOf[owner] -= _value;`. If the subtraction exceeds the maximum value representable by the `uint` type (`2^256 - 1`), it causes an integer overflow. This bypasses the subsequent `require` check, leading to unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies."
