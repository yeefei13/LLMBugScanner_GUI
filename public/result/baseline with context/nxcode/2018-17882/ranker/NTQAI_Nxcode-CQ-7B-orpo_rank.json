Here is the output in JSON format:

```json

      "function_name": "safeAdd",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The `safeAdd` function is used to prevent integer overflow when adding two numbers. However, it is not used in the `safeSub` function, which can lead to potential overflow issues.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "safeSub",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The `safeSub` function is used to prevent integer overflow when subtracting two numbers. However, it is not used in the `safeAdd` function, which can lead to potential overflow issues.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON output contains two vulnerabilities with a severity of 7, which is the highest severity level. The `safeAdd` and `safeSub` functions are used to prevent integer overflow, but they are not used in each other, which can lead to potential overflow issues.
