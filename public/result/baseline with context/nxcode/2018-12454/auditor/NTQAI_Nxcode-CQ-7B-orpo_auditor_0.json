            "reason": "The vulnerability exists in the line `curhash = sha256(block.timestamp, block.coinbase, block.difficulty, curhash);`. If the hash calculation exceeds the maximum value representable by the `uint` type (`2^256 - 1`), it causes an integer overflow. This bypasses the subsequent `require` check, leading to unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies."
