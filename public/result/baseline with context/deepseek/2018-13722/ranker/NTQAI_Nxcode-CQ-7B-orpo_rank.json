    "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
    "criticism": "The vulnerability exists in the line `totalAmount += _amounts[a];`. If the sum exceeds the maximum value representable by the `uint` type (`2^256 - 1`), it causes an integer overflow, bypassing the subsequent `require` check, leading to unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies. The use of `safeAdd` should have prevented this, but it is missing from the line in question, making the vulnerability possible.",
