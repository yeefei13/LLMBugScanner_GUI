            "reason": "Allows unlimited token minting without constraints, disrupting supply-demand balance. This can lead to a situation where the token's value decreases significantly, as the total supply increases without a corresponding increase in value."

If the sum exceeds the maximum value representable by the `uint` type (`2^256 - 1`), it causes an integer overflow. This bypasses the subsequent `require` check, leading to unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies."
