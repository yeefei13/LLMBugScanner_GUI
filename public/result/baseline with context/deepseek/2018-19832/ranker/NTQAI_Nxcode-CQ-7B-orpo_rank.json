      "function_name": "distr",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability in the `distr` function arises from the unchecked addition of `_amount` to `totalDistributed` and `totalRemaining`. This can lead to an integer overflow, which would bypass the subsequent check for `totalDistributed >= totalSupply`, allowing for unauthorized minting of tokens. The use of SafeMath functions is crucial here to prevent such overflows, but the current implementation does not enforce this, making the contract vulnerable.",

    {
      "function_name": "PayWinner",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Bad Randomness",
      "criticism": "The `PayWinner` function relies on predictable or non-secure methods for selecting winners, which can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the outcome. Secure random number generation mechanisms should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability, ensuring fair and unpredictable winner selection.",

    {
      "function_name": "ToOwner",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Access Control",
      "criticism": "The function `ToOwner` allows any user to claim ownership, which is a significant security flaw. This can be exploited by malicious actors to take control of the contract, leading to potential theft of funds or other assets. Proper access control mechanisms should be implemented to prevent such scenarios.",
