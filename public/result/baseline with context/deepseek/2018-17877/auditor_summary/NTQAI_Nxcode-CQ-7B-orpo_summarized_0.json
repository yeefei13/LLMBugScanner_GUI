However, the refund logic is improperly tied to state updates, which can lead to a situation where the contract becomes unusable if the balance is not sufficient to send back the ether. This can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."

The addition operation can lead to an integer overflow if the value of `_hearts` is very large, causing the function to fail and potentially lead to a denial of service."
