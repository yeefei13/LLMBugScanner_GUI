      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability in the `distr` function arises from the unchecked addition of `_amount` to `totalDistributed` and `totalRemaining`. This can lead to an integer overflow, which would bypass the subsequent check for `totalDistributed >= totalSupply`, allowing for unauthorized distribution of tokens. The use of SafeMath functions is missing here, which is crucial for preventing such vulnerabilities.",

      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Bad Randomness",
      "criticism": "The `PayWinner` function relies on predictable or non-secure methods for selecting winners, which can be exploited by attackers. Without secure randomness, the selection of winners can be manipulated, leading to potential exploitation and financial losses. This is a significant vulnerability that needs to be addressed with secure random number generation.",

      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Token Devalue",
      "criticism": "The `mintToken` function allows for unlimited minting without any constraints, which can lead to a significant devaluation of the token. This is a critical vulnerability as it can be exploited to manipulate the token's value and potentially lead to its devaluation. The absence of any minting limits or constraints is a significant concern.",
