### Explanation of Scores:

1. **stopGame Function (Access Control)**
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly restricts access to the owner only, which is a good practice for controlling critical functions. However, the lack of a balance check before transferring funds to the owner (`owner.transfer(address(this).balance);`) introduces a risk. This could be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract's balance, making it unusable for future games. Therefore, the score is 7 out of 9.
   - **Severity**: The severity is high because it directly affects the functionality of the contract, potentially rendering it unusable by users. The ability to stop the game should be controlled carefully, and this function lacks the necessary checks to ensure safe operation. Score: 8 out of 9.
   - **Profitability**: While the direct financial impact of this vulnerability is not immediately clear, it does reduce the profitability of the contract by potentially draining its funds. However, the score is not as high because the vulnerability is more about the contract's usability rather than direct financial loss. Score: 5 out of 9.

2. **fallback Function (Denial of Service)**
   - **Correctness**: The fallback function allows users to withdraw their funds at any time, which could lead to a denial of service if the contract is drained of funds. This is a significant issue because it effectively stops users from participating in the game. The score is 6 out of 9 because the function is correctly implemented to allow withdrawals, but the lack of checks or safeguards could lead to a DoS.
   - **Severity**: The severity is very high because it can prevent users from withdrawing their funds, effectively locking their assets. This could lead to a significant loss of funds for users and could severely impact the usability and trust in the contract. Score: 9 out of 9.
   - **Profitability**: While this vulnerability could potentially reduce the profitability of the contract by preventing users from withdrawing their funds, the score is not as high because the primary impact is on the usability and trust of the contract rather than direct financial loss. Score: 4 out of 9.
