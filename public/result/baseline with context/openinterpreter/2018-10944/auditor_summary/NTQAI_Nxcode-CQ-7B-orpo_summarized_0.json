The input you provided is not a valid JSON format. It seems like you have nested JSON objects and arrays within each other, which is not a valid JSON structure. 

However, if you want to create a JSON object with an empty "output_list" array, you can do it like this:

```json
{
    "output_list": []
}
```

If you want to add more items to the "output_list", you can do it like this:

```json
{
    "output_list": [
        {
            "function_name": "function_name_1",
            "vulnerability": "short_vulnera_desc_1",
            "reason": "reason_1"
        },
        {
            "function_name": "function_name_2",
            "vulnerability": "short_vulnera_desc_2",
            "reason": "reason_2"
        }
    ]
}
```

Please provide more details about the input you want to convert to JSON format if you want a more specific solution.
