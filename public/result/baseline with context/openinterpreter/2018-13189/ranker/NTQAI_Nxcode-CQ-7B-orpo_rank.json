      "criticism": "The vulnerability exists in the line `totalAmount += _amounts[a];`. If the sum exceeds the maximum value representable by the `uint` type (`2^256 - 1`), it causes an integer overflow. This bypasses the subsequent `require` check, leading to unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies.",
