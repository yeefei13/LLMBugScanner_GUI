The input you provided is not in a structured format that can be converted into a JSON. It seems to be a string of hexadecimal characters. 

If you want to convert this string into a JSON format, you would need to first understand the structure of the data and then write a program or script to parse it and convert it into a JSON format. 

However, without more information about the structure of the input data, it's impossible to provide a specific solution. 

If you can provide more details about the input data, I would be happy to help you with the conversion.
