Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "transfer",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Potential for an attacker to steal funds from another user.",
      "criticism": "The function relies on a vulnerable condition where the sender does not verify the address of the receiver, allowing an attacker to potentially send funds to a wrong address.",
      "correctness": 3,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 3
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Potential for an attacker to steal funds from another user.",
      "criticism": "The function relies on a vulnerable condition where the sender does not verify the address of the receiver, allowing an attacker to potentially send funds to a wrong address.",
      "correctness": 3,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON output contains two vulnerabilities, both with a severity of 7. However, since the correctness value is 3 for both, they are not considered as "correct" vulnerabilities and are therefore not deleted.
