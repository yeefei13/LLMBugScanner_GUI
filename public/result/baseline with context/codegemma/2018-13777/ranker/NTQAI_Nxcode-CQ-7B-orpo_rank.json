{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Missing access control checks in the function",
      "criticism": "The function relies on the caller's balance to verify the transaction, allowing potential exploitation of the function by malicious actors. The function does not adequately protect against invalid input, allowing a potential increase in the value of the _value parameter to bypass the function's safety measures and cause a potential loss of funds.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON output contains only the vulnerability with the highest severity, which is "transferFrom".
