Uncontrolled token transfer can lead to potential security risks and misuse.
So, this vulnerability could be exploited by malicious users to transfer tokens freely.",
            "criticism": "The vulnerability is at the application level. The way to exploit it would be to find a way to transfer tokens without having to interact with the contract. This could be achieved by a simple phishing attack where a malicious user tricks another user into executing transactions.",
