Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "NFT",
      "auditor_idx": "1",
      "vulnerability": "Incomplete contract",
      "criticism": "The contract is missing some key functions such as minting, burning, and transferring ownership. This could lead to security vulnerabilities and loss of funds.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "Ownable",
      "auditor_idx": "1",
      "vulnerability": "Incomplete contract",
      "criticism": "The contract is missing some key functions such as renouncing ownership and transferring ownership to a new owner. This could lead to security vulnerabilities and loss of funds.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "Cryptogs",
      "auditor_idx": "1",
      "vulnerability": "Incomplete contract",
      "criticism": "The contract is missing some key functions such as setting the IPFS hash, setting the slammer time, and getting the IPFS hash. This could lead to security vulnerabilities and loss of funds.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, all the vulnerabilities have a severity of 7, which is the highest possible severity. Therefore, the output is the same as the input.
