            "vulnerability": "Bad Randomness",
            "reason": "The mintToken function uses the `newArr` function, which uses `Math.random` to generate random values. Since `Math.random` generates a random value between 0 and 1, the `newArr` function will generate a random value between 0 and 1 for each element in the array. This introduces a potential for bad randomness, which can be criticized."
