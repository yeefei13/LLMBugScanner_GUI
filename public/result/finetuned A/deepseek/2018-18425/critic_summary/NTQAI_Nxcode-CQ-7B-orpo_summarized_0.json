This can be exploited by granting a malicious attacker the owner role, allowing them to distribute large amounts of tokens to their own address, effectively draining funds from the contract. The vulnerability is correctness: high, as it allows the owner to steal funds from the contract due to the lack of access control. The severity is medium, as it can be exploited in real world applications. The profitability is high, as it can generate significant financial gains for attackers.",
