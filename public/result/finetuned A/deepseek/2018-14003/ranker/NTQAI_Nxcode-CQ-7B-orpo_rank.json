      "function_name": "batchTransfer",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The 'batchTransfer' function allows a user to transfer a large amount of tokens to multiple recipients in a single transaction. However, the function does not check if the total amount to be transferred exceeds the sender's balance, leading to an integer overflow where the sender's balance is decremented by an incorrect value, resulting in a net positive balance for the attacker. This vulnerability is severe because it can be exploited to steal large amounts of tokens from users, making it highly profitable for attackers.",
      "correctness": 8,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 9
    }
