            "reason": "The 'batchTransfer' function allows a user to transfer a large amount of tokens to multiple recipients in a single transaction. However, the function does not check if the total amount to be transferred exceeds the sender's balance, leading to an integer overflow where the sender's balance is decremented by an incorrect value, resulting in a net positive balance for the attacker."

            "reason": "The 'transferFrom' function allows a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of the token owner, but it does not check if the spender's allowance is sufficient for the transfer. This can be exploited by a malicious spender to transfer tokens without the owner's consent, leading to a loss of assets."
