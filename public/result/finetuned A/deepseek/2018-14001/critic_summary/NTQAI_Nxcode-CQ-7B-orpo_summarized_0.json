The output value of '_value * cnt' is prone to overflow, causing the function to fail in unexpected ways. The severity is relatively high because it can lead to a significant financial loss for attackers. The profitability is moderate because attackers might exploit this vulnerability in a large-scale manner, but it is not a lucrative target for attackers."
