This is a severe issue as it can permanently lock funds, causing significant financial loss to users. However, the reasoning provided is incorrect. Integer overflow does not directly impact the transfer function in this manner; it only affects the addition of balances, which is safe if the sender has enough balance. The real issue lies in the unprotected increase in allowance, as detailed in the subsequent entries.",
