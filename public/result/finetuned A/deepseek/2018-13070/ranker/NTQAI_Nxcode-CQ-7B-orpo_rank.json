      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Access Control",
      "criticism": "The selfdestructs function is marked as onlyOwner, but it does not check if the owner is actually the contract itself, allowing attackers to steal funds. This is a severe vulnerability because it can be exploited to steal funds from the contract, making the entire system unusable. However, the profitability of this vulnerability is low because it only benefits the attacker, and the attacker would need to exploit the vulnerability to steal funds, which is not economically efficient.",

      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 1
    },

      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The transferFrom function does not check if the target address is a smart contract, allowing attackers to exploit the token contract by interacting with a malicious contract, causing a denial of service. This is a severe vulnerability because it can be exploited to make the entire system unusable, making it economically efficient for attackers to exploit this vulnerability. However, the correctness of this vulnerability is high because the logic in the function is incorrect, allowing attackers to exploit it.",

      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 8
    }
