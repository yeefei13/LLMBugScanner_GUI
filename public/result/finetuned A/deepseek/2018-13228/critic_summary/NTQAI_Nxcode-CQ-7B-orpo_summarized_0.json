This vulnerability has a correctness score of 9, severity score of 8, and profitability score of 7. The incorrectness is high because it can lead to a severe financial issue where users' balances are frozen. The impact is substantial because it can disable the utility of the token. The exploitability is high because it requires a high degree of trust towards the owner. However, the profitability is moderate because it is not always beneficial to the attacker due to the potential detection and community backlash.",
