This is highly critical as it can lead to the devaluation of the token, causing financial loss to investors and trust erosion in the project. However, the incentive structure of the vulnerability is low, as the only way a user can exploit it is through a direct attack from the owner, and it is not profitable in a public setting. Therefore, the correctness score is set to 8 due to the severe nature of the overflow, but the profitability score is set to 1 because it is not practical.",
