This is a high severity vulnerability because it can permanently freeze funds owned by users, leading to a significant financial loss. However, the profitability of exploiting this vulnerability is low due to the restrictive conditions imposed by the integer overflow, which makes it less likely for attackers to successfully execute the overflow in practice.",
