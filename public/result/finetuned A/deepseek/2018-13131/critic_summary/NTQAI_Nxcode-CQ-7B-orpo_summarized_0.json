            "criticism": "The mint function allows the preSale agent to mint tokens for an arbitrary user without checking the potential overflow of totalSupply. This can lead to a situation where the totalSupply exceeds the TOKEN_LIMIT, allowing the attacker to mint unlimited tokens, which can be sold for real value, thus causing severe financial loss to the investors. The vulnerability is correctness issue because it arises from the incorrect implementation of mint function, allowing arbitrary minting without overflow check.",
