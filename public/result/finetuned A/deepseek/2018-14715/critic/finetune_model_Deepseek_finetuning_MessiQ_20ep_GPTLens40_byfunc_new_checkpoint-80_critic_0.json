This is highly critical as it can lead to the owner draining the contract's balance, making the entire system unusable. The incentive for the owner to exploit this vulnerability is maximal, and the impact is catastrophic. However, the exploitability is limited by the availability of owner's private key, thus reducing the severity. The profitability is high due to the critical nature of the vulnerability.",
