            Output Restrictions: 
                    The output list must contain exactly two entries, each with a unique function name, a unique vulnerability, a detailed criticism, and a correctness, severity, and profitability score between 0 and 9.
                        The output must strictly follow the specified JSON formatting, including the auditor index, function name, vulnerability, criticism, and scores.
                        The correctness score must reflect the likelihood of exploitation, the severity score must reflect the impact, and the profitability score must reflect the incentive for attackers.
