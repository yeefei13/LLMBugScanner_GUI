This is a severe vulnerability because it can be exploited to devalue the entire token supply, making it valueless. However, the profitability of exploiting this vulnerability is low due to the stringent ownership controls and the requirement to own existing token supply, making it more of a academic flaw than a practical one.",

The severity of this vulnerability is high due to the potential for widespread impact and exploitative nature.
