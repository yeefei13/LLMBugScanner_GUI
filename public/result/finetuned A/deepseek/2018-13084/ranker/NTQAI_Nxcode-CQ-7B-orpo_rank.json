{"output_list": [{"function_name": "mintToken", "auditor_idx": 0, "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow", "criticism": "The mintToken function does not check for overflow, allowing the owner to mint arbitrary amounts of tokens to any user account, causing a buy price to become 0 and locking the contract. This is a severe vulnerability as it can lead to the complete loss of funds for affected users, and it is easy to exploit due to the lack of any access restrictions on the minting function.", "correctness": 8, "severity": 9, "profitability": 7}]}
