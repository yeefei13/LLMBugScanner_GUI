            "criticism": "The 'enterWithReferral' function allows an attacker to overflow the balance of the contract due to a typo in the code, allowing the attacker to gain a large amount of tokens. The typo is in the line 'uint256 referrerCut = SafeMath.div(room.entryPrice, 100);', where '100' should be '10' to represent 10% of the entry price. The typo causes the referrerCut to be set to a much larger value, allowing attackers to gain a large amount of tokens. This vulnerability is of high severity and correctness, as it is a typo in the code that causes a major issue. However, it is of low profitability, as it is unlikely that attackers would exploit this vulnerability due to the large amount of tokens required to overflow the balance.",

The typo is in the line 'CTO.transfer(halfFee);', where 'CTO' should be 'msg.sender' to distribute the funds to the rightful CTO. This typo causes the attacker to gain the funds instead of the rightful players, resulting in a loss for the players.
