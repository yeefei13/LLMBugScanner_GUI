This is a critical issue because it can lead to the devaluation or complete loss of user assets, causing significant financial loss and trust issues for users. The incentive for the owner to exploit this vulnerability is very high due to the control they gain, and the impact on users is catastrophic. However, the exploitability is limited because it can only be exploited during the token creation phase, making it less profitable in the open market.",
