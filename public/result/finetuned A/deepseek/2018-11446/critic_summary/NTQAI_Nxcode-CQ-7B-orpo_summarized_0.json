This vulnerability is highly exploitable due to the severe impact on user funds, and it is straightforward to implement a profitable attack. However, the requirement to have a non-zero balance in 'totalLockedRewardsOf' to unlock rewards introduces an additional layer of protection, mitigating the severity to a certain extent. Nonetheless, the initial exposure to this overflow is a critical issue.",
