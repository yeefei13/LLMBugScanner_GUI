The function does include overflow checks in the '_transfer' internal function, which is called by 'transfer'. The issue arises from the 'burnPerTransaction' variable, which is added to the transfer amount, thus causing an integer overflow when the total supply is very low. The provided reasoning does not accurately reflect the nature of the vulnerability.",

The function restricts a spender from being approved more than once, which can be exploited by a malicious spender to lock funds in a contract. This restriction limits the functionality of the token and creates a vulnerability where users cannot increase their allowance without allowing it once before." ,
