However, it fails to check for integer overflow, where the total amount to be distributed can overflow the sender's balance, leading to a situation where the owner's balance becomes negative, and the recipients receive more tokens than they should. This vulnerability is severe because it can permanently devalue the token, making it valueless and causing significant financial loss to recipients.",

However, it does not check if the spender is the owner, allowing a spender to transfer funds to themselves, if they are the owner, thus bypassing the intended logic.
