            "criticism": "The mintToken function does not have a check on the mintedAmount parameter, allowing an overflow of the total supply. This is a severe vulnerability as it can be exploited to steal funds from users, leading to a complete loss of assets. The incentive for attackers is very high due to the large financial impact, and the exploitability is straightforward, making it a high-risk issue.",
