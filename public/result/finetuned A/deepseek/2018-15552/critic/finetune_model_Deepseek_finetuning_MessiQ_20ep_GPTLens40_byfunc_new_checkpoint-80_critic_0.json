This can lead to a critical issue where 'totalBounty' is large, causing an integer overflow and allowing the contract owner to steal funds from the lotto system. The issue arises because 'winnerPrice' is calculated as 'totalBounty - ownerTax', and without proper overflow checks, 'totalBounty' can be manipulated to overflow 'winnerPrice', allowing the contract owner to steal funds. This vulnerability is severe, as it can lead to a permanent loss of funds from the contract, making it unsuitable for any real-world applications. However, it is not very profitable, as it requires a malicious attacker to exploit the vulnerability, and the only benefit is the theft of funds from the contract.
