This vulnerability is severe because it allows attackers to increase their token balance without cost, leading to a significant decrease in token value. However, the reasoning is not completely correct. The overflow occurs in the function 'distr', not 'getTokens'. Moreover, the overflow does not directly lead to an increase in attackers' token balance, but rather allows the owner to set an impossibly high value for 'value' in 'getTokens', causing a misallocation of tokens.",
