            "criticism": "The mintToken function does not have a check on the mintedAmount parameter, allowing an overflow of the total supply. This is a critical issue as it can be exploited to steal funds from users, making it highly exploitable and detrimental to user trust and assets. However, the requirement to ensure only the owner can mint tokens without any restrictions, and the incentive to not have a minting function in a public token, reduces the severity of this vulnerability. The profitability is also low due to the requirement of minting capabilities only in the ownership phase and the potential misuse of funds through this exploit.",

This is a severe issue as it can lead to incorrect balances and inconsistencies in the token distribution, potentially allowing attackers to steal funds from buyers. The high correctness score is attributed to the intentional overflow mechanism in the buy function, aligning with the requirement to restrict the buy function to the owner only during the presale, thus limiting the exploitable surface area.
