Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "mintToken",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The provided code snippet incorrectly identifies integer overflow vulnerabilities in the mintToken function. These overflows do not exist in the mintToken function, as it correctly increments the total supply and the target address's balance, ensuring no overflow can occur. The reasoning provided is incorrect.",
      "correctness": 1,
      "severity": 1,
      "profitability": 1
    },
    {
      "function_name": "distributeToken",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The provided code snippet incorrectly identifies integer overflow vulnerabilities in the distributeToken function. These overflows do not exist in the distributeToken function, as it correctly increments the balances of the target addresses, ensuring no overflow can occur. The reasoning provided is incorrect.",
      "correctness": 1,
      "severity": 1,
      "profitability": 1
    },
    {
      "function_name": "_transfer",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The provided code snippet incorrectly identifies integer overflow vulnerabilities in the _transfer function. These overflows do not exist in the _transfer function, as it correctly decrements the sender's balance and increments the recipient's balance, ensuring no overflow can occur. The reasoning provided is incorrect.",
      "correctness": 1,
      "severity": 1,
      "profitability": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the output is the same as the input, as none of the vulnerabilities have a correctness value of 0.
