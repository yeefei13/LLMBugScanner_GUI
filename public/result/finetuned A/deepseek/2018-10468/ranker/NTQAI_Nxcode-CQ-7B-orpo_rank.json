This includes totalContribution, totalSupply, totalBonusTokensIssued, and purchasingAllowed, which could be indicative of the contract's financial health and operational status. The vulnerability is correctness: it does not enforce any access control, allowing anyone to retrieve these values. The severity is high: these values are crucial to the contract's operation and security, and their exposure can lead to exploitative scenarios. The profitability is medium: while these values are sensitive, the function is not often called, and the information can be inferred from other contract interactions. Therefore, it is scored a 7.",

This could lead to the contract being unusable by its rightful owner. The vulnerability is correctness: it does not enforce any access control, allowing anyone to buy tokens if purchasing is enabled. The severity is high: this unrestricted token distribution can lead to financial loss for the contract owner. The profitability is medium: while this issue can be exploited, it requires a specific condition (purchasingAllowed set to true), making it less likely to be exploited in practice. Therefore, it is scored a 8.",
