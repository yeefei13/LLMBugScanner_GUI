 ### Instruction:
Use the Task below and the Input given to write the Response, which is a programming code that can solve the following Task:

### Task:
Make a smart contract to create a token called "Blood Coin" with the symbol "BLOOD". The smart contract should allow users to transfer tokens to other addresses, set the balance of an address, and check the balance of an address. The smart contract should also have an owner who can transfer ownership to another address. Additionally, the smart contract should have a function to set the price of the token in real world currency (RWC) and a function to set the price of the token in wei (W). The smart contract should also have a function to set the maximum amount of tokens that can be sold in a single transaction.

### Solution:
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;
contract owned {
    address public owner;
    function owned() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) onlyOwner public {
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
interface tokenRecipient { function receiveApproval(address _from, uint256 _value, address _token, bytes _extraData) public; }
contract BloodCoin is owned {
    string public name = "Blood Coin";
    string public symbol = "BLOOD";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply = 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
