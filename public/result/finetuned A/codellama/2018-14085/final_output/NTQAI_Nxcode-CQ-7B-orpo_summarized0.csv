2018-14085,Extract the auditor_idx,The addSweeper function does not check if the _sweeper address is already registered as a sweeper for the given _token. This could allow an attacker to add multiple sweepers for the same token, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.,addSweeper
2018-14085,Extract the auditor_idx,The sweep function does not check if the _token address is a valid token contract. This could allow an attacker to sweep tokens from unauthorized contracts, potentially leading to financial losses or security vulnerabilities.,sweep
2018-14085,Extract the auditor_idx,The sweep function does not check if the _destination address is a valid address. This could allow an attacker to sweep tokens to an unauthorized address, potentially leading to financial losses or security vulnerabilities.,sweep
2018-14085,Extract the auditor_idx,The sweep function does not check if the _amount is greater than 0. This could allow an attacker to sweep 0 tokens, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.,sweep
2018-14085,Extract the auditor_idx,The sweep function does not check if the _data is valid. This could allow an attacker to sweep tokens with invalid data, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.,sweep
2018-14085,Extract the auditor_idx,The sweep function does not check if the _minutes is greater than 0. This could allow an attacker to sweep tokens immediately, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.,sweep
2018-14085,Extract the auditor_idx,The sweep function does not check if the _maxTries is greater than 0. This could allow an attacker to sweep tokens with unlimited tries, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.,sweep
2018-14085,Extract the auditor_idx,The sweep function does not check if the _maxFee is greater than 0. This could allow an attacker to sweep tokens with unlimited fees, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.,sweep
