Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": []
}
```

Explanation: The input JSON contains a single object with a key "output_list" that holds an array of vulnerability objects. The vulnerability object with "correctness" value equals 0.0 is removed from the array, and the resulting array is empty. Therefore, the output JSON contains an empty "output_list".
