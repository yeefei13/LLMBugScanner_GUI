The ETHEREUMBLACK smart contract is an ERC20 token that allows the owner to set the balance of an arbitrary user to any value. The most severe vulnerability in this smart contract is an integer overflow in the mintToken function, which allows an attacker to set an arbitrary user's balance to any value.
