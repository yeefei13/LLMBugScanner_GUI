If 'balances[_from]' is 0, it will be set to a large value, allowing arbitrary asset transfer. For 'allowed[_from][msg.sender]' overflow, it will also be set to a large value, allowing arbitrary asset transfer. For 'balances[_to]' overflow, it will be set to a large value, allowing arbitrary asset transfer. It is recommended to use SafeMath for 'balances[_from] -= _value' and 'balances[_to] += _value' to prevent overflow attacks.",
