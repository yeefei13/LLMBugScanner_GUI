The input you provided is not a valid JSON format. It seems to be a mix of JSON and human-readable text, which is not a standard format. However, I can try to extract the relevant information and format it into a JSON object.

Here's a possible interpretation of the input:

```json
{
    "output_list": [
        {
            "function_name": "<function_name_1>",
            "auditor_idx": 0,
            "vulnerability": "<short_vulnera_desc_1>",
            "criticism": "<criticism for reasoning and explanation for scoring>",
            "correctness": <0~9>,
            "severity": <0~9>,
            "profitability": <0~9>
        }
    ]
}
```

However, the repeated content in the "vulnerability" and "criticism" fields is not a valid JSON format. It seems to be a mistake in the input. If you can provide the correct input, I can format it into a valid JSON object.
