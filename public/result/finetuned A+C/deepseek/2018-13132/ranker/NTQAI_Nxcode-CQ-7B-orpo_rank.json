Here is the output in JSON format:

```json

      "auditor_idx": 0,

      "criticism": "The creditJackpotTokens function does not check for overflow, allowing users to receive arbitrary amounts of tokens.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, all the vulnerabilities have a severity of 9 and a profitability of 7, which means they are all of high severity and high profitability.
