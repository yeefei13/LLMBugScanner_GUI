      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The constructor 'MalaysianCoin' has an integer overflow vulnerability. The initial supply is set to a large value, and there is no check to ensure that the total supply does not overflow the uint256 data type. This can be exploited by assigning a large supply to a user, allowing the owner to lock funds in the smart contract.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
