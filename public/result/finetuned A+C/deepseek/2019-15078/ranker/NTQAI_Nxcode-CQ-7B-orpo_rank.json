Here is the output in JSON format:

      "vulnerability": "Bad Randomness",
      "criticism": "The 'value' variable is decreased by a fixed factor of 100000 during each distribution, which can be exploited by attackers to predict the amount of tokens each beneficiary will receive, leading to inaccurate distribution and potential token devaluation.",

      "profitability": 6
    },

      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The 'transferFrom' function does not check if the contract being transferred to is a smart contract, allowing it to be exploited by transferring tokens to a smart contract address owned by an attacker, resulting in untransferable tokens.",
      "correctness": 7,

      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Access Control",
      "criticism": "The 'approve' function allows users to approve a spender multiple times, which can be exploited by attackers to steal tokens from users by calling the 'approve' function multiple times with a large value, followed by a 'transferFrom' call.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, all vulnerabilities have a severity of 8, which is the highest severity level. Therefore, the output is the same as the input.
