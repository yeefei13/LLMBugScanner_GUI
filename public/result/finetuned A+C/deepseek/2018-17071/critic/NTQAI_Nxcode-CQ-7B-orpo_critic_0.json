Explanation:
1. Integer Overflow: The contract has an integer overflow vulnerability in the fallback function. The issue arises from the way the contract handles ether transfers based on the entry_number variable. Specifically, the requirement 'msg.value * 1000 < 9' allows attackers to exploit this vulnerability to gain more tokens than intended. An attacker can repeatedly send ether to the contract in a way that causes an integer overflow, thus allowing them to receive a disproportionately large amount of tokens.
   - Correctness: 7
   - Severity: 8
   - Profitability: 6

2. Access Control: The 'stopGame()' function allows the owner to arbitrarily set 'gameOn' to false, causing a denial of service to all users. This is because there is no restriction on who can call this function, allowing any user to exploit this vulnerability to disable the game, preventing users from withdrawing their funds.
   - Correctness: 6
   - Severity: 7
   - Profitability: 5
