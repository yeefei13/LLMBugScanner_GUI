            "reason": "The contract has an integer overflow vulnerability in the fallback function. The issue arises from the way the contract handles ether transfers based on the entry_number variable. Specifically, the requirement 'msg.value * 1000 < 9' allows attackers to exploit this vulnerability to gain more tokens than intended. An attacker can repeatedly send ether to the contract in a way that causes an integer overflow, thus allowing them to receive a disproportionately large amount of tokens."
