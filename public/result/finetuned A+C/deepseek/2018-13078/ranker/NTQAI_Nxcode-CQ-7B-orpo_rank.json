Here is the output in JSON format:

      "criticism": "The transfer function does not check if the target address is a contract, allowing users to transfer tokens to a smart contract, which can be harmful if the smart contract has vulnerabilities.",
      "correctness": 6,

      "profitability": 4
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The transferFrom function does not check if the target address is a contract, allowing users to transfer tokens to a smart contract, which can be harmful if the smart contract has vulnerabilities.",
      "correctness": 6,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the output is the same as the input, as there are no vulnerabilities with a correctness value of 0.
