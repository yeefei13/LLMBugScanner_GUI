Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "mint",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The mint function does not check for overflow, allowing users to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens. This can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner and users. The correctness of this vulnerability is 7, severity is 9, and profitability is 8.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 8
    },
    {
      "function_name": "addExp",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The addExp function does not check for overflow, allowing users to add an arbitrary amount of experience. This can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner and users. The correctness of this vulnerability is 7, severity is 9, and profitability is 8.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 8
    },
    {
      "function_name": "levelUp",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The levelUp function does not check for overflow, allowing users to increase their level to arbitrary values. This can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner and users. The correctness of this vulnerability is 7, severity is 9, and profitability is 8.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 8
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the output is the same as the input, as there are no vulnerabilities with a correctness value of 0.
