The condition 'require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value);' ensures that the sender has enough tokens to transfer, but it does not prevent the sender's balance from becoming negative due to underflow. This can be exploited by attackers to make the sender's balance appear to be positive while they have an effectively infinite amount of tokens."
