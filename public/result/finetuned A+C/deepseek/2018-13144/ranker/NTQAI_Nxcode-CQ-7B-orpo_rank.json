The vulnerabilities are sorted by severity in descending order. The top 5 most severe vulnerabilities are:

1. Integer Overflow in the 'transfer' and 'transferFrom' functions
2. Wrong Logic in the 'approve' and 'approveAndCall' functions
3. Typo Constructor in the 'HumanStandardToken' constructor function
