Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transferFrom function does not have proper checks to prevent integer overflow. An attacker can set an arbitrary value for an arbitrary user's balance by calling this function.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "mintToken",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The mintToken function does not have proper checks to prevent integer overflow. An attacker can set an arbitrary value for an arbitrary user's balance by calling this function.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

The output is already sorted by severity in descending order.
