Here is the output in JSON format:

}
```

As you can see, all the vulnerabilities have a severity of 9 and a profitability of 0, which means they are all of the same severity level. If you want to sort the vulnerabilities by severity, you can use a programming language like Python to parse the JSON and sort the list of vulnerabilities based on the severity value.
