            "criticism": "The setPrices function has an integer overflow. The function takes two uint256 parameters, newSellPrice and newBuyPrice, and assigns them to sellPrice and buyPrice respectively. However, there is no check to ensure that the new prices do not cause an integer overflow. If the new prices are too large, the function will revert and the state of the contract will be unchanged. This could potentially lead to loss of funds or other unintended consequences.",
