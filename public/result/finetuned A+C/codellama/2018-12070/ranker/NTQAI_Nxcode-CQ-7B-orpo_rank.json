      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The mintToken function allows an attacker to set the balance of an arbitrary user to any value, which can lead to integer overflow and potentially result in loss of funds for the attacker or other users.",

      "profitability": 7
    },
