Explanation:
The vulnerability in the mintToken function is an integer overflow. The totalSupply variable is of type uint256, which is a 256-bit unsigned integer. When the mintedAmount is added to the totalSupply, it may cause an integer overflow if the totalSupply exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a uint256. This can lead to incorrect results and potentially loss of funds.

The correctness score is 7, as the vulnerability is a common issue in smart contracts and can be easily fixed by using a safe math library or implementing a check to prevent integer overflow.

The severity score is 8, as the vulnerability can lead to significant loss of funds if not addressed.

The profitability score is 5, as the vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors to steal funds from the contract.
