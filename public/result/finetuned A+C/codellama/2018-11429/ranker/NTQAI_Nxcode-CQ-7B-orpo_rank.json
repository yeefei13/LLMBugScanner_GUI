      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The mintToken function has an integer overflow. The function does not check if the total supply of tokens will exceed the maximum allowed limit (150 million tokens) after the minting operation.

      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 6
    }
