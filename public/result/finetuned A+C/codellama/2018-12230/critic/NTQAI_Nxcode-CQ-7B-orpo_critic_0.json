Explanation:
The integer overflow vulnerability in the mintToken function is detected. The function is intended to add a specified amount of tokens to the target address's balance and update the total supply. However, the calculation of the new total supply is not correctly implemented, which can lead to an integer overflow if the mintedAmount is too large.

The correctness score is 7, as the vulnerability is detected but not immediately exploitable. The severity score is 8, as the vulnerability can cause a loss of funds for the target address. The profitability score is 5, as the vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors to gain control over the contract and steal funds.
