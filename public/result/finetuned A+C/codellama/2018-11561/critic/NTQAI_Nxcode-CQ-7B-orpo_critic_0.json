            "criticism": "The function distributeToken takes an array of addresses and a value to distribute. The calculation of the total value to be distributed is done by multiplying the length of the _extraData array with the _value. This can lead to an integer overflow if the length of the _extraData array is too large or if the _value is too large. This can result in the distribution of more tokens than intended or even negative balances.",
