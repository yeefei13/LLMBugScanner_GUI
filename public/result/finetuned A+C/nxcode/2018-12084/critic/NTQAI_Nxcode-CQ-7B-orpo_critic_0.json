Explanation:
The vulnerability in the mintToken function is that it does not check if the addition of the mintedAmount to the totalSupply will result in an overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to set any value for totalSupply, potentially leading to a loss of funds or other unintended consequences.

The correctness score is 7, as the function is not completely correct in its implementation. However, it is still a significant vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers.

The severity score is 9, as the vulnerability can lead to significant financial losses or other unintended consequences.

The profitability score is 5, as the vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to gain significant financial advantage.
