Explanation:
The mint function and the fallback function both have integer overflow issues. The 'check' variable is not validated before being used to update the totalSupply, which allows 'Founder1', 'Founder2', and 'Founder3' to set any 'totalSupply' value as they wish. This can lead to a loss of funds if the 'check' value is not validated properly. The correctness score is 7, severity score is 9, and profitability score is 0.

The auditor index is 0, indicating that this is the first auditor's assessment of the code.
