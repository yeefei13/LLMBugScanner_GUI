            "criticism": "The distributeToken function in the ERC20Token contract allows an attacker to set any user's balance by subtracting the specified value from the sender's balance and adding it to the recipient's balance. This can result in an integer overflow if the sender's balance is less than the specified value. The function does not check if the sender has enough balance to perform the transfer, which can lead to loss of funds for the sender.",
