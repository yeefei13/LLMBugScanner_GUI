            "criticism": "The distribute function has an integer overflow in the following code block: totalAmount += _amounts[a]; require(totalAmount > 0 && balances[msg.sender] >= totalAmount); if (_amounts[b] > 0) { balances[_addresses[b]] += _amounts[b]; Transfer(msg.sender, _addresses[b], _amounts[b]); } The vulnerability arises from the fact that the totalAmount variable is not properly checked for overflow before being added to the balances mapping. This could lead to an incorrect total supply of tokens, potentially leading to loss of funds for the sender.",
