      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The sell function in the MAVCash contract has an integer overflow vulnerability. The multiplication of 'amount' and 'sellPrice' can result in an overflow if 'amount' is large enough and 'sellPrice' is also large enough. This can lead to the contract's total supply being reduced, potentially leading to loss of funds for the contract owner. The correctness score is 7, severity score is 8, and profitability score is 5.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
