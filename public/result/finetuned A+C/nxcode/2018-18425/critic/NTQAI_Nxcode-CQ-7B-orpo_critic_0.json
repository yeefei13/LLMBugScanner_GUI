Explanation:
The vulnerability in the distributeToken function is an integer overflow. The function uses the SafeMath library's add function to add the _amount to totalDistributed, but it does not check if the result is greater than the totalSupply. This can lead to an overflow, where the distributed amount exceeds the total supply, potentially causing the contract to be insolvent or allowing users to receive more tokens than they should have.

The correctness score is 7 out of 9, as the vulnerability is present but not immediately exploitable. The severity score is 8 out of 9, as the vulnerability can lead to significant financial losses for the contract owner and users. The profitability score is 5 out of 9, as the vulnerability is not immediately exploitable and does not provide any immediate financial benefits.
