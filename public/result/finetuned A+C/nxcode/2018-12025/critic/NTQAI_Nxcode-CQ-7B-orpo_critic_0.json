Explanation:
The vulnerability in the mintToken function is that it does not check if the addition of the mintedAmount to the totalSupply will result in an overflow. This can lead to the totalSupply being set to a value that is higher than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly and potentially lead to loss of funds.

The correctness score is 7 because the function is not completely correct, but it is still a significant vulnerability. The severity score is 9 because the vulnerability can lead to significant damage to the contract and potentially loss of funds. The profitability score is 7 because the vulnerability can be exploited to gain control over the contract and potentially profit from the contract's value.
