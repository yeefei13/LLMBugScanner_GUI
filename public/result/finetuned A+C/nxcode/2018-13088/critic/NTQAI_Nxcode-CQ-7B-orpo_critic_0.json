Explanation:
The vulnerability in the mintToken function is that it does not check if the addition of the mintedAmount to the totalSupply will result in an overflow. This can be mitigated by using SafeMath library or by checking if the addition of the mintedAmount to the totalSupply will result in an overflow before increasing the totalSupply. The correctness score is 7 out of 9, indicating that the function is not completely correct, but it can be improved. The severity score is 8 out of 9, indicating that the vulnerability is severe, but it can be mitigated. The profitability score is 5 out of 9, indicating that the vulnerability is not profitable to exploit.
