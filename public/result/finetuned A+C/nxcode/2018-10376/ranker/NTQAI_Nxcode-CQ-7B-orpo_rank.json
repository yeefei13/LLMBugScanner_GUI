        "criticism": "The transferFrom function allows attackers to steal assets due to incorrect computations involving _value, _from and _to. The function does not check if the sender has sufficient balance to transfer the specified amount from the sender's account to the recipient's account. Additionally, it does not check if the recipient's account has sufficient balance to receive the specified amount. This can lead to unauthorized transfers and theft of assets.",
