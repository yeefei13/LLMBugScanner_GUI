      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The sell function in the JiucaiToken contract allows attackers to exploit the most recently minted token holder by selling it for a discounted price. The function assumes that the token holder has already bought the token, and then the attacker can sell it for a lower price to gain a profit. This vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing a more complex token sale mechanism, such as a fixed-price sale or a tiered pricing structure, to prevent attackers from exploiting the most recently minted token holder.",
