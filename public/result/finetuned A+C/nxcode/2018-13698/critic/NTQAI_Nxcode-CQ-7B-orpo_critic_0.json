Explanation:
The vulnerability in the mintTokens function is an integer overflow. The totalSupply variable is incremented by the value of promoValue, but there are no checks to ensure that the addition does not result in an overflow. This means that the owner can set totalSupply arbitrarily high, potentially leading to a loss of funds for the contract.

The correctness score is 7, as the vulnerability is present but not immediately exploitable. The severity score is 9, as the vulnerability can lead to significant financial losses for the contract. The profitability score is 7, as the vulnerability can be exploited to gain control of the contract and potentially cause significant financial losses.
