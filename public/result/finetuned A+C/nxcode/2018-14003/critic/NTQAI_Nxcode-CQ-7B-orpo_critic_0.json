Explanation:
The batchTransfer function in the WMCToken contract has an integer overflow vulnerability. The 'amount' variable is calculated incorrectly, which can lead to an integer overflow. This can be exploited by attackers to steal assets of the contract owner. The correctness score is 7, severity score is 8, and profitability score is 5.
