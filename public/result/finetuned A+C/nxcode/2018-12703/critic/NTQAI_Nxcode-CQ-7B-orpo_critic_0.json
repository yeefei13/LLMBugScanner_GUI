            "criticism": "The distributeToken function in the EighteenToken contract has an integer overflow vulnerability. The function allows unprotected financial losses between the _from and _to addresses due to a simple arithmetic operation. Integer overflow causes a large random value to be assigned to _from and _to, aka the 'tradeTrap' issue.",
