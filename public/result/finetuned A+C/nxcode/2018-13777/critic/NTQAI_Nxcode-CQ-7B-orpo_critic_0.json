Explanation:
The vulnerability in the mintToken function is that it allows the owner to set the totalSupply to any value, which can lead to an integer overflow. This can result in the totalSupply being set to a value that is beyond the maximum representable value for a uint256, causing the contract to behave unexpectedly.

The correctness score is 7, as the function is not completely correct, but it is still a common mistake in token contracts.

The severity score is 9, as the vulnerability can lead to the loss of funds for users who have already minted tokens.

The profitability score is 7, as the vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors to take control of the contract and steal tokens from users.
