Explanation:
The vulnerability in the mintToken function is that it does not check if the addition of the mintedAmount to the totalSupply will result in an overflow. This can lead to the totalSupply being set to a value that is higher than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly and potentially lead to loss of funds.

The correctness score is 7 because the vulnerability is present but not necessarily a security risk. It is a potential issue that can be addressed by adding a check for integer overflow.

The severity score is 8 because the vulnerability can lead to the contract behaving unexpectedly and potentially leading to loss of funds.

The profitability score is 6 because the vulnerability is not directly related to profitability but rather to the potential loss of funds.
