Explanation:
The vulnerability in the code is the integer overflow in the `sweep` function. The `amountInWei` variable is not checked for overflow before being transferred to the `destination` contract. This can lead to a loss of funds if the `amountInWei` is greater than the contract's balance.

The correctness score is 7 out of 9, as the vulnerability is present but not immediately exploitable. The severity score is 8 out of 9, as the vulnerability can lead to significant financial loss. The profitability score is 7 out of 9, as the vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors.
