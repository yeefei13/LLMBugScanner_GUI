Explanation:
The vulnerability in the batchTransfer function is the integer overflow. The calculation of the total amount of tokens to be transferred is incorrect, which can lead to an overflow. This can be mitigated by using SafeMath library for multiplication and addition operations. The correctness score is 7, severity score is 9, and profitability score is 7.
