Explanation:
The vulnerability in the mintToken function is that it does not check if the addition of the mintedAmount to the totalSupply would result in an overflow. This can lead to the total supply of the token being artificially increased, which can be exploited by attackers.

The correctness score is 7 because the vulnerability is present but not immediately exploitable. The severity score is 8 because the vulnerability can lead to significant damage to the token's value and reputation. The profitability score is 6 because the vulnerability can be exploited to gain significant profits.
