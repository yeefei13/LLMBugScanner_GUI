      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transfer function in the ATL contract uses the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, but it does not handle integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected financial losses between addresses due to truncation during addition of balances. The SafeMath library provides functions to prevent integer overflow, but they are not used in the transfer function.",
