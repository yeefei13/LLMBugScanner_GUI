      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The sell function in the MyBoToken contract has an integer overflow vulnerability. The multiplication of 'amount' and 'sellPrice' can result in zero if 'amount' is very large, which would reduce the seller's assets. This vulnerability can be mitigated by adding a check to ensure that 'amount * sellPrice' is not zero before transferring the funds to the seller. This would require modifying the sell function to include a check for the possibility of integer overflow.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,

    }
  ]
}
```
