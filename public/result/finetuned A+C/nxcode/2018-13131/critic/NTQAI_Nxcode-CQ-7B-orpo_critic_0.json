Explanation:
The vulnerability in the buyPreSaleTokens function is an integer overflow. The mint function call in the buyPreSaleTokens function does not have any checks to prevent integer overflow. This means that if the total supply of tokens exceeds the maximum limit (TOKEN_LIMIT), the mint function call will result in an integer overflow, allowing icoAgent to set the balance of an arbitrary user arbitrarily. This can lead to a loss of funds for the user and potentially damage the reputation of the token. The correctness of the function is 7 out of 9, severity is 9 out of 9, and profitability is 7 out of 9.
