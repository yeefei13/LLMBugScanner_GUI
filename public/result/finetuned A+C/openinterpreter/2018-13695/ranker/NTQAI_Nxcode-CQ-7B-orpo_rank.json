      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The fallback function allows anyone to mint tokens by sending ether to the contract. This can lead to integer overflow if the total supply is too large. This can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly and potentially lead to loss of funds.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 5
    }
  ]
