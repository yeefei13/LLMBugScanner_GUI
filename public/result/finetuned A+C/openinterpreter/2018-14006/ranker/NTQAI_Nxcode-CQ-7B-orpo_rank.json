This can lead to a loss of funds if the attacker is able to manipulate the input arrays to increase the total value transferred. The function does not contain any checks to prevent integer overflow, which could result in the attacker gaining control over the contract's balance.", "correctness": 7, "severity": 8, "profitability": 5}]}
