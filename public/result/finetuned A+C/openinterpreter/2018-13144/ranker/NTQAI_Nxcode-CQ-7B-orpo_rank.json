  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transferFrom function in the StandardToken contract has an integer overflow vulnerability. When the sender's balance is less than the value to be transferred, the function will subtract the value from the sender's balance and add it to the recipient's balance. This can result in a loss of funds if the sender's balance is very large and the value to be transferred is close to the maximum possible value for a uint256. The correctness of this function is 7, severity is 7, and profitability is 7.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This output contains the top 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the input JSON, sorted by severity. The output is in JSON format and contains the function name, auditor index, vulnerability, criticism, correctness, severity, and profitability of each vulnerability.
