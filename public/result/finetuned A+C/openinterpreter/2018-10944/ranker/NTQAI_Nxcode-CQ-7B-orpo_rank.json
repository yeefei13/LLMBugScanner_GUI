Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "transfer",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transfer function does not check if the transfer amount exceeds the balance of the sender. This can lead to integer overflow and result in the sender's balance being reduced to zero.",
      "correctness": 9,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 9
    },
    {
      "function_name": "approve",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The approve function does not check if the approval amount exceeds the balance of the owner. This can lead to integer overflow and result in the owner's balance being reduced to zero.",
      "correctness": 9,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 9
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transferFrom function does not check if the transfer amount exceeds the balance of the sender. This can lead to integer overflow and result in the sender's balance being reduced to zero.",
      "correctness": 9,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, all the vulnerabilities have a severity of 9, which is the highest possible severity. Therefore, the output is the same as the input.
