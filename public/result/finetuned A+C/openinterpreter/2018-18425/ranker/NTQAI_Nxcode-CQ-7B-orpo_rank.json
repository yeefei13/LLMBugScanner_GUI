      "function_name": "doAirdrop",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The doAirdrop function allows a potential trap due to overflow of totalDistributed variable, aka 'trapDoS' issue. This can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner and users who have already received airdrops. The totalDistributed variable is incremented without any checks, which can lead to an overflow if the number of airdrops exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This can be mitigated by using a SafeMath library to perform safe arithmetic operations.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This output contains the vulnerability with the highest severity, which is 7.
