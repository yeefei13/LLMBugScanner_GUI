            "reason": "The `mintToken` function is only restricted to the owner by the `onlyOwner` modifier. However, if an attacker can manipulate the `onlyOwner` check, they can mint unlimited tokens to their address, devaluing the token for other holders."

            "vulnerability": "Access Control",
            "reason": "The `transfer` function does not check if the recipient is a contract that implements the `tokenRecipient` interface. If the recipient is a contract that does not implement the `tokenRecipient` interface, the function will still execute, potentially leading to unauthorized token transfers."

            "reason": "The `setPrices` function does not validate the input prices, which could lead to incorrect pricing logic. For example, setting `sellPrice` or `buyPrice` to zero could lead to division by zero errors in the `buy` and `sell` functions."
