This can be particularly harmful if the attacker is able to control the `_value` or the `_to` address, allowing them to gain unintended tokens."

An attacker can exploit this by sending a very small value of ether, causing the multiplication to overflow and resulting in a large amount of tokens being transferred to the attacker."
