The condition `balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]` will always be false if `_value` is non-zero because adding `_value` to `balanceOf[_to]` cannot be less than `balanceOf[_to]`. This check is ineffective and does not prevent integer overflow. The correct check should be `if (balanceOf[_to] > balanceOf[_to] + _value) revert();` which is not the case here.",
