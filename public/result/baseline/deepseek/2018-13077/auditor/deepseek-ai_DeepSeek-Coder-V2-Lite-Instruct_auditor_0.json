            "reason": "The `mintToken` function allows the owner to mint new tokens and assign them to any address without any restrictions. This can lead to the creation of unlimited tokens, devaluing the token's value and potentially freezing the tokens in the process."

This typo could lead to confusion and potential misuse, where someone mistakenly calls `setPrices` instead of the intended constructor function, leading to incorrect initialization of the contract."
