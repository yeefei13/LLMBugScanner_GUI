However, due to the use of multiplication with a literal value, if msg.value is large enough, this condition can be true, leading to an integer overflow.

            "reason": "The logic in this contract is flawed. The contract pays out rewards based on the entry_number, which is incremented with each transaction. However, the conditions for payout are not correctly aligned. For example, if entry_number is a multiple of 999, the contract pays out 80% to the caller and 11% to the owner. This means that if entry_number is a multiple of 999, the payout to the caller is significantly higher than intended, and the owner still receives a disproportionate share of the rewards."

However, there is no check to ensure that the owner cannot re-enable the game after it has been stopped. An attacker could potentially exploit this by repeatedly calling 'stopGame' and 'startGame' to drain the contract's balance while keeping the game temporarily disabled."

This can be exploited if the value of ether significantly decreases after the contract has been deployed. An attacker could then front-run the payout, buy ether at a lower price, and profit from the difference."
