            "criticism": "The check `if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) throw;` is flawed because it uses addition to check for overflow, which is not the correct method. This can lead to false negatives and false positives. The correct approach would be to use the addition and check if the result is less than one of the operands, which would indicate an overflow. This flaw can be exploited to increase the balance of any account arbitrarily.",

This allows a frozen account to transfer tokens, which can be exploited to freeze tokens in a specific account.

This is particularly dangerous in a crowdsale scenario where tokens are minted for investors without proper verification.
