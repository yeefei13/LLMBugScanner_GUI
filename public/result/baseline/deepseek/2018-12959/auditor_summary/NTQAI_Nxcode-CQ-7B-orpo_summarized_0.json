If `_value` is large, `balances[msg.sender]` will be decremented beyond the minimum value, leading to an integer overflow and potentially allowing an attacker to transfer more tokens than they should."

An attacker can use the `transferFrom` function to transfer tokens on behalf of others without their consent, leading to unauthorized token transfers."
