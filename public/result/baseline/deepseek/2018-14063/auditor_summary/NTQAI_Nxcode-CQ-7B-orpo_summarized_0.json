This occurs because if `balances[_to]` is very large, adding a small `_amount` can still satisfy the condition, allowing the transfer to proceed with more tokens than actually exist."

This can be exploited by an attacker to reset the allowance to zero without their permission, allowing them to transfer tokens without any approval."
