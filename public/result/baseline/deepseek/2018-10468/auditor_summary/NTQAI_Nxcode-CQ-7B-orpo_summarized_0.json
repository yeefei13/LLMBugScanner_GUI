            "reason": "The 'getStats' function does not properly restrict access, allowing anyone to call it and retrieve sensitive information about the contract, including the total supply and other internal state variables. This can be exploited by attackers to gain insights into the contract's state, which could be used to plan further attacks."

This is a critical vulnerability as it can lead to the theft of tokens from the contract."

This can lead to a situation where an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain more tokens than they should by sending a large value that causes an overflow, leading to a denial of service or theft of tokens."
