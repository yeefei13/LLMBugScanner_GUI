Specifically, the check `require(balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to])` is flawed because it does not prevent overflow. If `balances[_to]` is very large, adding `_value` could cause an overflow, leading to unintended behavior where tokens are added to an account without any corresponding reduction in the sender's balance.",
