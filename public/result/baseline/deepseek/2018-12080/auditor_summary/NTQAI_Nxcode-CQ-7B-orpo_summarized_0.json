            "reason": "The `mintToken` function allows the owner (onlyOwner modifier) to mint new tokens and assign them to any address. This can lead to the creation of unlimited tokens, devaluing the token's value and potentially freezing other tokens in circulation."

            "reason": "The `transferFrom` function does not check if the allowance is greater than or equal to the value being transferred. This can lead to a situation where a user attempts to transfer more tokens than allowed by the spender, causing a denial of service or unintended token transfer."
