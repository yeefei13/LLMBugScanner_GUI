It should check if `balanceOf[_to] + _value` is greater than or equal to `balanceOf[_to]` to ensure no overflow. The current condition allows overflow, which can lead to incorrect balance updates. This is a significant vulnerability as it can lead to unpredictable behavior and potentially allow attackers to exploit other parts of the contract.",

This is a significant vulnerability as it allows an attacker to set these prices to values that are not reasonable or intended, such as extremely high or low values, which can disrupt the normal functioning of the contract and potentially lead to other vulnerabilities or exploits.

This typo can lead to incorrect token allocation and potentially allow for exploitation of the token's value. The initialization should be corrected to ensure the total supply is set as intended.",
