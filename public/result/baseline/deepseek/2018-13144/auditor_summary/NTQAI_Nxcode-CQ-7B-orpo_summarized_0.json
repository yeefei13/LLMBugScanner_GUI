If an attacker can manipulate the _value parameter to a very high value, it could cause an integer overflow, leading to incorrect balance updates and potentially allowing the attacker to transfer tokens they did not own."

An attacker can use this flaw to transfer tokens from other users' accounts without their consent by crafting a transaction that appears to come from the legitimate owner."

This allows an attacker to repeatedly call approveAndCall with a high value, effectively locking the tokens in the contract and preventing their use until the owner manually resets the allowance."
