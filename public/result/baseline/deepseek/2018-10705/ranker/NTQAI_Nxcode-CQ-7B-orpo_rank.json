This can lead to an integer overflow, allowing an attacker to manipulate the total supply of tokens or user balances, leading to significant financial loss. The use of 'safeAdd' without overflow checking negates its purpose and introduces a high risk of exploitation.",

This can lead to a situation where an attacker can call this function with a malicious contract as the spender, leading to unauthorized token transfers. The lack of a proper check on the spender type exposes the contract to potential exploitability.",
