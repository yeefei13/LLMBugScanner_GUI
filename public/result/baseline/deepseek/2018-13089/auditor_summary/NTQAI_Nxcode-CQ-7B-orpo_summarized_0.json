            "function_name": "mintToken",
            "vulnerability": "Access Control",
            "reason": "The `mintToken` function is only restricted to the owner by the `onlyOwner` modifier. However, there is no check to ensure that the `mintedAmount` does not exceed the intended supply limit. This could allow an attacker to mint unlimited tokens, devaluing the token and potentially exploiting other contracts that rely on the token's total supply."

            "function_name": "transfer",
            "vulnerability": "Access Control",
            "reason": "The `transfer` function does not check if the account being transferred to is a contract that can handle the ERC20 tokens. This could lead to a reentrancy attack where an attacker's contract can intercept the transfer and drain funds."

            "function_name": "burn",
            "vulnerability": "Access Control",
            "reason": "The `burn` function allows any user to burn their own tokens without any restrictions. This could lead to a situation where a user burns tokens, reducing the total supply, and then buys back the tokens at a lower supply, manipulating the token's value."

            "function_name": "setPrices",
            "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
            "reason": "The `setPrices` function does not validate the prices being set. If an attacker can manipulate the `newSellPrice` and `newBuyPrice`, they could set these to extremely high or low values, making the buy and sell functions vulnerable to exploitation."

            "function_name": "buy",
            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "reason": "The `buy` function uses division to calculate the token amount based on the amount of Ether sent. If `buyPrice` is zero, this could lead to an integer overflow, allowing an attacker to buy an unlimited number of tokens with very little Ether."
