            "reason": "The transfer function does not check for integer overflow, which can occur if the balance of the sender is greater than or equal to the transfer amount but the addition of the transfer amount to the recipient's balance would cause an overflow, leading to unintended behavior and potential loss of funds."

            "vulnerability": "Access Control",
            "reason": "The transferFrom function does not properly check the 'frozenAccount' status of the sender, allowing transfers from frozen accounts. This can lead to unauthorized transfers, which can be exploited to freeze tokens or transfer them to other addresses without permission."

            "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",

            "reason": "The burn function does not account for the possibility that burning tokens might cause the total supply to drop below the balance of any other account. This can lead to situations where attempting to burn tokens results in a denial of service, as the total supply cannot be reduced below the current balances of other accounts."
