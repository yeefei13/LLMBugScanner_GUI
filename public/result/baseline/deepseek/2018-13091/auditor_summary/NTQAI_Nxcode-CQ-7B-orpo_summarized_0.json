            "reason": "The `mintToken` function allows the owner to create new tokens without any upper limit, which can lead to inflation and devaluation of the token. Attackers can exploit this to create unlimited tokens, reducing the value of existing tokens."

The logic should ensure that the total supply remains consistent and that the owner's balance is not negatively affected without a corresponding minting event."
