This can allow a frozen account to still transfer tokens, which can be exploited if the owner's account is compromised, leading to unauthorized token transfers.",

            "criticism": "The function allows the owner to mint tokens without any restrictions, which can lead to the creation of unlimited tokens. This is particularly dangerous if the token is used as a utility token where the supply should be limited, as it can lead to devaluation of the token.",

If `newSellPrice` or `newBuyPrice` are set to zero, it could lead to a situation where users can buy or sell tokens at a price that is too favorable to the attacker, potentially exploiting the token's value.",
