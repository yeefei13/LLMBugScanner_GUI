            "criticism": "The function calculates the total amount to be deducted from the sender's balance by multiplying the number of receivers (`cnt`) by the transfer value (`_value`). If `cnt` is large, `amount` can overflow and become less than the expected value, allowing the sender to transfer more tokens than they actually have. This is a critical vulnerability because it can lead to unauthorized token transfers, potentially draining the contract of its funds.",

If the price is set too high, it can lead to a situation where the token's value is devalued as sellers can sell tokens at a higher price than their actual value.
