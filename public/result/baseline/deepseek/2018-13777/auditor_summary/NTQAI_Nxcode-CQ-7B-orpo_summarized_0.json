            "reason": "The function does not check for the possibility of an integer overflow when updating the balance of the sender and receiver. This can be exploited by an attacker to mint tokens without any limitation, leading to a significant loss of tokens."

            "reason": "The `mintToken` function allows the owner to mint new tokens and assign them to any address. This function lacks any access control checks, allowing anyone to mint tokens, which can be used to devalue the token or manipulate the token distribution."
