            "reason": "The constructor sets the totalSupply to 59347950076, which is a large number that can lead to an integer overflow when performing arithmetic operations. This can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the balances of tokens in unexpected ways."

The first require statement checks if the sender's balance is greater than the transfer amount, but it should check if the sender's balance is at least the transfer amount to avoid underflow. This can lead to a denial of service attack if an attacker can manipulate the transfer amount."

If these prices are not properly validated or derived from a secure source of randomness, an attacker could manipulate these prices to their advantage, such as buying tokens at a lower price and selling them at a higher price."
