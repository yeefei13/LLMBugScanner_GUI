            "reason": "The initial supply is set to 2000000000000000000000000000 tokens, which is a very large number. This can lead to token devaluation as the token's value is not proportionate to its intended use or utility. This is particularly dangerous if the token is used as a medium of exchange or has other real-world applications."
