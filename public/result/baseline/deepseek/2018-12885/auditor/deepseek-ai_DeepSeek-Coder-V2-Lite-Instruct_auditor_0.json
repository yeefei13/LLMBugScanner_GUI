However, the addition of the new champion to the array can lead to an integer overflow if the `leaderboard.length` is very large, allowing an attacker to manipulate the `id` of the new champion and potentially gain control over other critical data structures."

However, `blockhash` is deprecated in Solidity 0.5.0 and removed in Solidity 0.6.0, and `randNonce` is not securely random.
