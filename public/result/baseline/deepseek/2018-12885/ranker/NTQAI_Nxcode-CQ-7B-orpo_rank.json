      "function_name": "createChamp",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function `createChamp` uses `champs.push` to add a new champion to the `champs` array, which increments the array length. This length is then used to set the `id` of the new champion. However, the function does not check if the array length exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256, which could lead to an integer overflow. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the `id` of the new champion, potentially leading to the compromise of other critical data structures.",

      "vulnerability": "Access Control",
      "criticism": "The `withdrawChamp` function allows the owner of a champion to withdraw rewards based on their position in the leaderboard. However, the function does not check if the `position` is within a valid range (1 to 800). An attacker could manipulate the `position` value to gain access to other users' rewards or to exploit other parts of the contract that rely on the `position` value. This could lead to significant financial loss and undermine the trust in the contract.",

      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Bad Randomness",
      "criticism": "The `randMod` function uses `blockhash` and `randNonce` to generate a random number. However, `blockhash` is deprecated in Solidity 0.5.0 and removed in Solidity 0.6.0, and `randNonce` is not securely random. This makes the random number generation predictable and potentially exploitable by attackers who can manipulate the `blockhash` or control the block number to influence the outcome. This could lead to predictable outcomes in critical functions like lootbox openings, which could be exploited for financial gain.",
