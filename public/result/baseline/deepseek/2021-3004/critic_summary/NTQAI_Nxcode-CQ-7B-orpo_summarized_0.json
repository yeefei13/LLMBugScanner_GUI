This vulnerability could lead to an integer overflow if `amount` is very large, which could be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service or gain unauthorized access to funds. The lack of boundary checks is a significant vulnerability that could lead to severe consequences.",

This vulnerability poses a similar risk of integer overflow, which could be used to manipulate the contract's state and potentially steal funds. The absence of safeguards in these critical functions is a major concern.",
