This is a critical vulnerability as it allows an attacker to transfer more tokens than actually available in the sender's balance, leading to an unexpected increase in the balance of the recipient.",

This is a critical vulnerability because it allows an attacker to mint an unlimited number of tokens without any limit, effectively devaluing the token. The lack of overflow checks in this function makes it extremely dangerous.",

If the `sellPrice` is reduced after an attacker has bought tokens at a higher price, the attacker can sell tokens at a loss, effectively devaluing the token. This vulnerability is significant as it introduces a risk of financial loss for token holders.",
