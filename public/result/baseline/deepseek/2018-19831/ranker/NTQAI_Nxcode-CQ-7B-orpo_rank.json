      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function Mining24 sets the balance of the caller to totalDistributed without any checks, which can lead to an integer overflow if totalDistributed is not initialized correctly or if the caller's balance is manipulated to exceed the maximum uint256 value. This is a severe vulnerability as it can cause the contract to become unusable and lead to significant financial loss.",

      "criticism": "The distr function allows distribution of tokens to any address without any access control. This can lead to unauthorized distribution of tokens, potentially leading to token devaluation or loss of tokens for legitimate holders. The lack of access control is a critical issue that compromises the integrity and security of the token distribution process.",

      "vulnerability": "Access Control",
      "criticism": "The getTokens function allows whitelisted addresses to receive tokens without any restrictions, which can lead to unauthorized distribution of tokens and potential token devaluation. This is a significant vulnerability as it bypasses the intended distribution mechanism and exposes the token to potential theft.",
