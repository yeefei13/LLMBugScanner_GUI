            "reason": "The contract does not check for integer overflow when subtracting `_amount` from `balances[msg.sender]`. If `_amount` is large, it could cause `balances[msg.sender]` to wrap around, leading to an incorrect balance being stored and potentially allowing an attacker to transfer more tokens than they actually hold."

            "function_name": "transferFrom",
            "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
            "reason": "The contract does not decrement the `allowed` mapping when tokens are transferred, which means that the allowance could be exceeded if the allowance is not properly managed by the spender. This could lead to a situation where a user can transfer more tokens than what is allowed by the owner."

            "vulnerability": "Access Control",
            "reason": "The contract does not check if the `_spender` is the owner before approving the transfer. This means that any address can be approved to spend tokens on behalf of the owner, which can lead to unauthorized spending."

            "reason": "The contract does not check if the total amount being distributed is valid or if the sender has enough balance to distribute. If `totalAmount` is larger than `balances[msg.sender]`, it will revert, but if it's smaller, it could lead to the tokens being distributed at a devalued rate, as the sender's balance is reduced without any corresponding decrease in the total supply."
