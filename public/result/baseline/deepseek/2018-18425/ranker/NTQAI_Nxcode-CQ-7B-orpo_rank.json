      "function_name": "getTokens",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function `getTokens` uses a multiplication operation `tokens = tokensPerEth.mul(msg.value) / 1 ether;` which can lead to an integer overflow if `tokensPerEth` is very large and `msg.value` is sufficiently large. This is because the multiplication operation does not include a check for overflow, which can cause the result to be truncated incorrectly. This vulnerability can lead to incorrect distribution of tokens, which is a significant issue as it affects the fairness and integrity of the token distribution.",

      "criticism": "The `distr` function does not check if the totalDistributed amount exceeds the totalSupply, allowing anyone to call this function and distribute tokens beyond the intended supply, leading to a potential loss of tokens for legitimate holders. This is a severe vulnerability as it compromises the integrity of the token distribution and can lead to significant financial loss for token holders.",

This can be exploited by an attacker to airdrop tokens to their own address, effectively stealing tokens from the contract. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows unauthorized token transfers and can lead to significant financial loss for the contract owner.",
