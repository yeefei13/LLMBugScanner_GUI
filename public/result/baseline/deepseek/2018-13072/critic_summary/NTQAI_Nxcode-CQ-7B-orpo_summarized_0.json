The condition `balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]` will always be true if `_value` is non-zero, because adding `_value` to `balanceOf[_to]` should not result in a decrease. This check is misleading and does not prevent overflow. It should be removed or corrected to properly check for overflow.",
