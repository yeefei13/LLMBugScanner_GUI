 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and explanations:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) returns (bool) {
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `sub` and `add` functions in the `SafeMath` library are used to perform arithmetic operations on the `balances` mapping. However, these functions do not check for integer overflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

For example, if the `balances` mapping contains a large value and the `_value` parameter passed to the `transfer` function is a large value, the `sub` function can overflow and return an incorrect result. Similarly, the `add` function can also overflow and return an incorrect result.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transferFrom` Function

Function Name: `transferFrom`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(_to != address(0));
    require(_value <= balances[_from]);
    require(_value <= allowed[_from][msg.sender]);
    balances[_from] = balances[_from].sub(_value);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
    allowed[_from][msg.sender] = allowed[_from][msg.sender].sub(_value);
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transferFrom` function checks that the `_value` parameter is less than or equal to the balance of the `_from` address and the allowance of the `_from` address for the `msg.sender` address. However, the function does not check that the `_value` parameter is less than or equal to the balance of the `_to` address.

Therefore, an attacker can transfer tokens from one address to another address, even if the `_to` address does not have enough balance to receive the tokens.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `increaseApproval` Function

Function Name: `increaseApproval`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function increaseApproval (address _spender, uint _addedValue) public returns (bool success) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = allowed[msg.sender][_spender].add(_addedValue);
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, allowed[msg.sender][_spender]);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `increaseApproval` function uses the `add` function from the `SafeMath` library to add the `_addedValue` parameter to the allowance of the `_spender` address for the `msg.sender` address. However, the function does not check for integer overflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

For example, if the allowance of the `_spender` address for the `msg.sender` address is a large value and the `_addedValue` parameter is a large value, the `add` function can overflow and return an incorrect result.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `transfer_tokens_after_ICO` Function

Function Name: `transfer_tokens_after_ICO`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function transfer_tokens_after_ICO(address[] addresses, uint256 _value)
{
       require(_value <= balances[msg.sender]);
 for (uint i = 0; i < addresses.length; i++) {
   balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
   balances[addresses[i]] += _value;
   Transfer(msg.sender, addresses[i], _value);
    }
}
```
Reason: The `transfer_tokens_after_ICO` function allows anyone to transfer tokens to a list of addresses after the ICO. However, the function does not check that the `msg.sender` address has enough balance to transfer the tokens.

Therefore, an attacker can transfer tokens from one address to another address, even if the `msg.sender` address does not have enough balance to transfer the tokens.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `Globecoin` Constructor

Function Name: `Globecoin` Constructor

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function Globecoin () { 
Transfer(initial, _base , max);
Transfer(_x0, this , available);
Transfer(_initial, funds, custom);
Transfer(_base, fee, custom);
Transfer(base, owner, max);
balances[_initial] = i;  
balances[initial] = balances[_initial]; 
balances[_base] = balances[_initial]; 
balances[base] = balances[_base]; 
balances[_x0] = balances[_base]; 
balances[funds] = (initialSupply/4 - 4*i); 
balances[msg.sender] = (initialSupply/8); 
balances[owner] = (initialSupply/2 - 3*i); 
balances[fee] = (initialSupply/8 - i); 
balances[this] = 3 * i;
totalSupply = initialSupply;    
  }
```
Reason: The `Globecoin` constructor has a typo in the `balances` mapping. The `balances[_initial]` mapping is set to `i`, which is a small value. However, the `balances[initial]` mapping is set to `balances[_initial]`, which is a large value.

Therefore, the `balances[initial]` mapping is set to a large value, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
