 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow:

Function: `transferProxy`

Vulnerability: Integer overflow in the `transfer` function, which can cause the contract to lose control of its funds.

Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `+` operator to add the `_value` and `_feeSmt` parameters, which can cause an integer overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value of a uint256. This can lead to the contract losing control of its funds, as the `transfer` function will not be able to transfer the correct amount of tokens.

2. Wrong Logic:

Function: `approveProxy`

Vulnerability: Wrong logic in the `approve` function, which can cause the contract to approve the wrong address.

Reason: The `approve` function uses the `keccak256` function to hash the `_from`, `_spender`, and `_value` parameters, but it does not include the `nonce` parameter in the hash. This means that the `approve` function can approve the wrong address if the `nonce` parameter is not included in the hash.

3. Bad Randomness:

Function: `allocateTokens`

Vulnerability: Bad randomness in the `allocateTokens` function, which can cause the contract to allocate tokens to the wrong addresses.

Reason: The `allocateTokens` function uses the `keccak256` function to hash the `_owners` and `_values` parameters, but it does not include the `allocateEndTime` parameter in the hash. This means that the `allocateTokens` function can allocate tokens to the wrong addresses if the `allocateEndTime` parameter is not included in the hash.

4. Access Control:

Function: `transferProxy`

Vulnerability: Access control in the `transferProxy` function, which can allow unauthorized users to transfer tokens.

Reason: The `transferProxy` function uses the `transferAllowed` modifier to check if the `_from` address is allowed to transfer tokens. However, this modifier does not check if the `_to` address is allowed to receive tokens. This means that an attacker can use the `transferProxy` function to transfer tokens to an unauthorized address.

5. Typo Constructor:

Function: `SMT`

Vulnerability: Typo in the `SMT` constructor, which can cause the contract to lose control of its funds.

Reason: The `SMT` constructor uses the `allocateEndTime` parameter to set the end time for token allocation. However, it does not check if the `allocateEndTime` parameter is set correctly. This means that an attacker can use the `SMT` constructor to set the `allocateEndTime` parameter to a past date, which can cause the contract to lose control of its funds.
