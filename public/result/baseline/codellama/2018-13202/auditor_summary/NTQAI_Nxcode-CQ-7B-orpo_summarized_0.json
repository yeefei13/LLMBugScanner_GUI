            "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
            "reason": "The `transferFrom` function uses the `allowance` mapping to check if the sender has enough allowance to transfer the tokens. However, the function does not check if the allowance is greater than the balance of the sender, which can lead to a situation where a user can transfer more tokens than they actually have."

            "reason": "The `burn` function uses the `msg.sender` address to determine the amount of tokens to burn. However, this can lead to a situation where a user can burn more tokens than they actually have, as the `msg.sender` address can be manipulated by an attacker."

However, this modifier can be bypassed by an attacker who has access to the contract's owner address. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can freeze the account of another user without their consent."
