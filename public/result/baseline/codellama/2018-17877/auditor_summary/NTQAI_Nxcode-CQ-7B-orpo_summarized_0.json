This means that if the number of hearts that can be bought exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a uint256, the function will overflow and the result will be incorrect."

The keysRec() function from the GreedyHeartCalcLong library is used to calculate the number of hearts that can be bought with the given amount of Ether. However, this function uses a formula that is not correct, as it does not take into account the current round's Ether balance."
