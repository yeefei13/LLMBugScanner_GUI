 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and intermediate reasoning:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `balanceOf` Function

Function Name: `balanceOf`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint balance) {
    if (!created[_owner] && balances[_owner] == 0) {
        return free;
    }
    else {
        return balances[_owner];
    }
}
```
Reason: The `balanceOf` function uses the `created` mapping to check if an address has been created, and if not, it returns the `free` value. However, if the `free` value is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, which can lead to a loss of funds.

Intermediate Reasoning: The `free` value is set to 100 * 10 ** uint256(decimals), which is a large number. If the `balanceOf` function is called with an address that has not been created, and the `free` value is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, which can lead to a loss of funds.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public {
    _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function calls the `_transfer` function with the `msg.sender` as the first parameter, which is the address of the sender. However, if the sender is a contract, it can cause a problem.

Intermediate Reasoning: If the sender is a contract, it can cause a problem because the `msg.sender` address is used to check if the sender has enough funds to transfer. If the contract does not have enough funds, it can cause a problem.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `burn` Function

Function Name: `burn`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function burn(uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value);   
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;            
    totalSupply -= _value;                      
    emit Burn(msg.sender, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `burn` function uses the `msg.sender` address to check if the sender has enough funds to burn. However, if the sender is a contract, it can cause a problem.

Intermediate Reasoning: If the sender is a contract, it can cause a problem because the `msg.sender` address is used to check if the sender has enough funds to burn. If the contract does not have enough funds, it can cause a problem.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `freezeAccount` Function

Function Name: `freezeAccount`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner public {
    frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
    emit FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
}
```
Reason: The `freezeAccount` function is only accessible to the owner of the contract. However, if the owner is a contract, it can cause a problem.

Intermediate Reasoning: If the owner is a contract, it can cause a problem because the `freezeAccount` function is only accessible to the owner of the contract. If the contract does not have the correct permissions, it can cause a problem.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `FreeCoin` Contract

Function Name: `FreeCoin`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function FreeCoin(
    uint256 initialSupply,
    string tokenName ,
    string tokenSymbol
) TokenERC20(initialSupply, tokenName, tokenSymbol) public {}
```
Reason: The `FreeCoin` contract has a typo in its constructor. The `TokenERC20` constructor is called with the `initialSupply`, `tokenName`, and `tokenSymbol` parameters, but the `FreeCoin` constructor is called with the `initialSupply`, `tokenName`, and `tokenSymbol` parameters.

Intermediate Reasoning: The `TokenERC20` constructor is called with the `initialSupply`, `tokenName`, and `tokenSymbol` parameters, but the `FreeCoin` constructor is called with the `initialSupply`, `tokenName`, and `tokenSymbol` parameters. This can cause a problem because the `FreeCoin` constructor is not properly initialized.
