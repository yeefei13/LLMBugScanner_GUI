 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) {
    if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < _value) revert();           
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) revert(); 
    if (frozenAccount[msg.sender]) revert();                
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;                     
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;                            
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);                   
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `+=` operator to update the balance of the sender and the recipient. However, this operator can cause an integer overflow if the balance of the sender or the recipient is too large. This can lead to a loss of funds and a security vulnerability.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transferFrom` Function

Function Name: `transferFrom`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    if (frozenAccount[_from]) revert();                        
    if (balanceOf[_from] < _value) revert();                 
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) revert();  
    if (_value > allowance[_from][msg.sender]) revert();   
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                          
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;                            
    allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transferFrom` function uses the `allowance` mapping to check if the sender has enough allowance to transfer the funds. However, this check is not sufficient, as it only checks if the sender has enough allowance, but not if the recipient has enough balance to receive the funds. This can lead to a loss of funds and a security vulnerability.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `buy` Function

Function Name: `buy`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function buy() payable {
    if(isSelling == false) revert();
    uint amount = msg.value * buyRate;                  
    balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;                   
    balanceOf[owner] -= amount;                         
    Transfer(owner, msg.sender, amount);                
}
```
Reason: The `buy` function uses the `msg.value` variable to calculate the amount of tokens to be transferred. However, this variable is not secure, as it can be manipulated by the sender. This can lead to a loss of funds and a security vulnerability.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `withdrawToOwner` Function

Function Name: `withdrawToOwner`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function withdrawToOwner(uint256 amountWei) onlyOwner {
    owner.transfer(amountWei);
}
```
Reason: The `withdrawToOwner` function allows any user to withdraw funds to the owner's account. However, this function should only be accessible to the owner of the contract. This can lead to a loss of funds and a security vulnerability.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `FujintoToken` Contract

Function Name: `FujintoToken`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function FujintoToken(
    uint256 initialSupply,
    string tokenName,
    uint8 decimalUnits,
    string tokenSymbol
) token (initialSupply, tokenName, decimalUnits, tokenSymbol) {}
```
Reason: The `FujintoToken` contract has a typo in its constructor. The `token` keyword should be capitalized, but it is not. This can lead to a loss of funds and a security vulnerability.

Note: These vulnerabilities are not exploitable in real-world scenarios, but they can be exploited by a malicious actor with access to the contract's source code.
