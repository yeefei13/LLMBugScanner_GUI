      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The `transferFrom` function uses the `allowed[from][msg.sender] >= value` condition to check if the `msg.sender` has enough allowance to transfer the funds. However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that the `msg.sender` has enough funds to transfer. If the `msg.sender` has a large allowance, but the `balances[from]` is small, the `transferFrom` function will still allow the transfer to happen, even though the `msg.sender` does not have enough funds.

An attacker can create a new contract that listens to the `Transfer` event and then uses the `mintToken` function to mint new tokens. This can lead to a loss of control over the token supply.
