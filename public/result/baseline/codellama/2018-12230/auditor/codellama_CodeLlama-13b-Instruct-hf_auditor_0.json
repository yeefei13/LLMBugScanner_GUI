 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address to, uint value) returns (bool success) {
    if (frozenAccount[msg.sender]) return false;
    if(balances[msg.sender] < value) return false;
    if(balances[to] + value < balances[to]) return false;
    balances[msg.sender] -= value;
    balances[to] += value;
    Transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `+=` operator to add the `value` parameter to the `balances[to]` variable. However, if the `value` parameter is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, which can lead to a loss of funds.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transferFrom` Function

Function Name: `transferFrom`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint value) returns (bool success) {
    if (frozenAccount[msg.sender]) return false;
    if(balances[from] < value) return false;
    if( allowed[from][msg.sender] >= value ) return false;
    if(balances[to] + value < balances[to]) return false;
    balances[from] -= value;
    allowed[from][msg.sender] -= value;
    balances[to] += value;
    Transfer(from, to, value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transferFrom` function uses the `allowed[from][msg.sender] >= value` condition to check if the `msg.sender` has enough allowance to transfer the funds. However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that the `msg.sender` has enough funds to transfer. If the `msg.sender` has a large allowance, but the `balances[from]` is small, the `transferFrom` function will still allow the transfer to happen, even though the `msg.sender` does not have enough funds.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `mintToken` Function

Function Name: `mintToken`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function mintToken(address target, uint256 mintedAmount) onlyOwner{
    balances[target] += mintedAmount;
    totalSupply += mintedAmount;
    Transfer(0,owner,mintedAmount);
    Transfer(owner,target,mintedAmount);
}
```
Reason: The `mintToken` function uses the `Transfer` event to mint new tokens. However, the `Transfer` event is not secure, as it can be easily manipulated by an attacker. An attacker can create a new contract that listens to the `Transfer` event and then uses the `mintToken` function to mint new tokens. This can lead to a loss of control over the token supply.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `freezeAccount` Function

Function Name: `freezeAccount`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner {
    frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
    FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
}
```
Reason: The `freezeAccount` function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to ensure that only the owner can freeze an account. However, this modifier is not sufficient to ensure that the owner has the authority to freeze an account. An attacker can create a new contract that listens to the `FrozenFunds` event and then uses the `freezeAccount` function to freeze an account. This can lead to a loss of control over the token supply.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `RemiCoin` Constructor

Function Name: `RemiCoin` Constructor

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function RemiCoin(uint256 initial_supply, string _name, string _symbol, uint8 _decimal) {
    balances[msg.sender]  = initial_supply;
    name                  = _name;
    symbol                = _symbol;
    decimals              = _decimal;
    totalSupply           = initial_supply;
}
```
Reason: The `RemiCoin` constructor uses the `msg.sender` variable to set the initial supply of tokens. However, this variable can be easily manipulated by an attacker. An attacker can create a new contract that listens to the `Transfer` event and then uses the `RemiCoin` constructor to set the initial supply of tokens. This can lead to a loss of control over the token supply.

Note: These vulnerabilities are not exploitable in the current version of the smart contract, but they can be exploited in future versions if the contract is updated.
