            "reason": "The burn amount is calculated as burnPerTransaction + _value, where burnPerTransaction is a fixed value and _value is the amount of tokens being transferred. If _value is large enough, the sum of burnPerTransaction and _value can overflow, resulting in a negative burn amount."

            "reason": "The transferFrom function checks the allowance of the sender before transferring tokens. However, the allowance is not checked against the amount of tokens being transferred. This means that an attacker can transfer tokens without having enough allowance, effectively bypassing the allowance check."

            "function_name": "Hexagon",

            "reason": "The Hexagon constructor sets the balance of the contract creator to the initial supply, but it does not set the balance of the contract itself to the initial supply. This means that the contract does not have enough tokens to transfer or burn, effectively making it unable to function properly."
