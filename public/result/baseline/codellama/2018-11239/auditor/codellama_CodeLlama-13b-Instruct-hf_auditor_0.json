 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow:

Function: `_transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer overflow in the calculation of the burn amount.

Reason: The burn amount is calculated as `burnPerTransaction + _value`, where `burnPerTransaction` is a fixed value and `_value` is the amount of tokens being transferred. If `_value` is large enough, the sum of `burnPerTransaction` and `_value` can overflow, resulting in a negative burn amount. This can be exploited by an attacker to transfer a large amount of tokens without burning any tokens, effectively devaluing the token.

2. Wrong Logic:

Function: `transferFrom`

Vulnerability: Wrong logic in the allowance check.

Reason: The `transferFrom` function checks the allowance of the sender before transferring tokens. However, the allowance is not checked against the amount of tokens being transferred. This means that an attacker can transfer tokens without having enough allowance, effectively bypassing the allowance check.

3. Bad Randomness:

Function: `burn`

Vulnerability: Bad randomness in the burn amount.

Reason: The `burn` function burns a fixed amount of tokens, regardless of the amount of tokens being transferred. This can be exploited by an attacker to burn a large amount of tokens, effectively devaluing the token.

4. Access Control:

Function: `approve`

Vulnerability: Lack of access control in the allowance check.

Reason: The `approve` function allows any address to set the allowance of another address. This means that an attacker can set the allowance of another address to a large amount, effectively allowing them to transfer a large amount of tokens without having enough allowance.

5. Typo Constructor:

Function: `Hexagon`

Vulnerability: Typo in the constructor.

Reason: The `Hexagon` constructor sets the balance of the contract creator to the initial supply, but it does not set the balance of the contract itself to the initial supply. This means that the contract does not have enough tokens to transfer or burn, effectively making it unable to function properly.
