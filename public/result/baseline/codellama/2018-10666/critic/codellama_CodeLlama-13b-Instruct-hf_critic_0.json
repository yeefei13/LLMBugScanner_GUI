 Here is the output for the given vulnerabilities and reasoning:

{
    "output_list": [
        {
            "function_name": "safeMul",
            "auditor_idx": 0,
            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "criticism": "The safeMul function uses the * operator to multiply two numbers, which can lead to integer overflow if the product is too large to fit in a 256-bit integer. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service or steal funds from the contract.",
            "correctness": 9,
            "severity": 9,
            "profitability": 9

            "function_name": "safeSub",
            "auditor_idx": 0,
            "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
            "criticism": "The safeSub function uses the require statement to check if the second number is less than or equal to the first number. However, this check is not sufficient to ensure that the subtraction operation will not result in an underflow. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service or steal funds from the contract.",
            "correctness": 8,

            "auditor_idx": 0,
            "vulnerability": "Bad Randomness",
            "criticism": "The precalculate function uses the pow10 function to calculate the baseFeeDivisor and feeDivisor variables. However, the pow10 function uses a loop to calculate the power, which can be slow and may not be secure. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service or steal funds from the contract.",
            "correctness": 7,
            "severity": 7,
            "profitability": 7

        {
            "function_name": "setExportFee",
            "auditor_idx": 0,
            "vulnerability": "Access Control",
            "criticism": "The setExportFee function allows any address to set the export fee for any other address. However, this function does not check if the caller has the necessary permissions to set the export fee. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service or steal funds from the contract.",
            "correctness": 6,
            "severity": 6,
            "profitability": 6

            "function_name": "IDXM",
            "auditor_idx": 0,
            "vulnerability": "Typo Constructor",
            "criticism": "The IDXM constructor sets the totalSupply variable to 200000000000, which is a large number. However, this number is not checked for correctness, and it may be a typo. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service or steal funds from the contract.",
            "correctness": 5,
            "severity": 5,
            "profitability": 5
        }
    ]
}

Note: The scores are based on the severity and profitability of the vulnerabilities, and the correctness of the reasoning. The scores are not meant to be absolute, but rather a relative measure of the severity and profitability of the vulnerabilities.
