The variable i is of type uint8, which can only hold values up to 255. If the number of stats is greater than 255, the loop will not terminate and the function will not return the correct value."

The function checks if the new exp is equal to the old exp, but it does not check if the new exp is greater than the old exp. This means that if the new exp is less than the old exp, the function will not update the exp correctly."

The correct constructor is keccak256(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number), seed), now), but the function uses keccak256(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number), seed), now) instead.

This means that an attacker can exploit the vulnerability by calling the function with a token that has already been levelled up."
