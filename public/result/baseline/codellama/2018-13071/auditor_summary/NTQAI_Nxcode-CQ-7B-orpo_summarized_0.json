            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "reason": "The `transfer` function uses the `+=` operator to update the `balanceOf` mapping, which can lead to integer overflow if the balance of the sender or the recipient is too large. This can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly, such as allowing a user to transfer more tokens than they actually have."

            "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
            "reason": "The `transferFrom` function uses the `allowance` mapping to check if the sender has enough allowance to transfer the tokens. However, the function does not check if the allowance is greater than the balance of the sender, which can lead to a situation where a user can transfer more tokens than they actually have."

            "vulnerability": "Bad Randomness",
            "reason": "The `distributeTokens` function uses the `addresses` mapping to iterate over the addresses of the token holders. However, the function does not check if the addresses are valid or if the holders have actually transferred any tokens. This can lead to a situation where a user can receive tokens that they did not actually transfer."
