 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and function code:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) {
    if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < _value) throw;           
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) throw; 
    if (frozenAccount[msg.sender]) throw;                
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;                     
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;                            
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);                   
    if(_value > 0){
        if(balanceOf[msg.sender] == 0){
            addresses[indexes[msg.sender]] = addresses[lastIndex];
            indexes[addresses[lastIndex]] = indexes[msg.sender];
            indexes[msg.sender] = 0;
            delete addresses[lastIndex];
            lastIndex--;
        }
        if(indexes[_to]==0){
            lastIndex++;
            addresses[lastIndex] = _to;
            indexes[_to] = lastIndex;
        }
    }
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `+=` operator to update the `balanceOf` mapping, which can lead to integer overflow if the balance of the sender or the recipient is too large. This can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly, such as allowing a user to transfer more tokens than they actually have.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transferFrom` Function

Function Name: `transferFrom`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    if (frozenAccount[_from]) throw;                        
    if (balanceOf[_from] < _value) throw;                 
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) throw;  
    if (_value > allowance[_from][msg.sender]) throw;   
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                          
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;                            
    allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transferFrom` function uses the `allowance` mapping to check if the sender has enough allowance to transfer the tokens. However, the function does not check if the allowance is greater than the balance of the sender, which can lead to a situation where a user can transfer more tokens than they actually have.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `distributeTokens` Function

Function Name: `distributeTokens`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function distributeTokens(uint startIndex,uint endIndex) onlyOwner returns (uint) {
    uint distributed = 0;
    require(startIndex < endIndex);
    for(uint i = startIndex; i < lastIndex; i++){
        address holder = addresses[i+1];
        uint reward = balanceOf[holder] * 3 / 100;
        balanceOf[holder] += reward;
        distributed += reward;
        Transfer(0, holder, reward);
    }
    totalSupply += distributed;
    return distributed;
}
```
Reason: The `distributeTokens` function uses the `addresses` mapping to iterate over the addresses of the token holders. However, the function does not check if the addresses are valid or if the holders have actually transferred any tokens. This can lead to a situation where a user can receive tokens that they did not actually transfer.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `freezeAccount` Function

Function Name: `freezeAccount`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner {
    frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
    FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
}
```
Reason: The `freezeAccount` function is only accessible to the owner of the contract, which can lead to a situation where a user can freeze the account of another user without their consent.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `CCindexToken` Contract

Contract Name: `CCindexToken`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Contract Code:
```
contract CCindexToken is owned, token {
    uint256 public sellPrice;
    uint256 public buyPrice;
    mapping(address=>bool) public frozenAccount;
    event FrozenFunds(address target, bool frozen);
    uint256 public constant initialSupply = 40000000 * 10**18;
    uint8 public constant decimalUnits = 18;
    string public tokenName = "CCindex10";
    string public tokenSymbol = "T10";
    function CCindexToken() token (initialSupply, tokenName, decimalUnits, tokenSymbol) {}
    ...
}
```
Reason: The `CCindexToken` contract has a typo in its constructor, where it calls the `token` constructor with the wrong number of arguments. This can lead to a situation where the contract is not initialized correctly, which can cause unexpected behavior.

Note: These vulnerabilities are exploitable in real-world scenarios and can be beneficial to attackers. It is important to thoroughly test and audit smart contracts to identify and fix these types of vulnerabilities before deploying them to production.
