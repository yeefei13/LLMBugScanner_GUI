            "vulnerability": "Integer overflow",
            "criticism": "The mul() function in SafeMath uses the * operator to perform multiplication, which can lead to integer overflow if the product is too large to fit in a uint variable. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack or a loss of funds.",

            "vulnerability": "Wrong logic",
            "criticism": "The div() function in SafeMath uses the / operator to perform division, which can lead to wrong results if the divisor is zero. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a loss of funds.",

            "vulnerability": "Bad randomness",
            "criticism": "The mint() function in ATL uses a fixed ico address to mint new tokens, which can lead to a lack of randomness in the token distribution. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a loss of funds.",

            "criticism": "The transfer() function in ATL does not check if the sender has enough tokens to transfer, which can lead to unauthorized token transfers. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a loss of funds.",

            "criticism": "The ATL() constructor in ATL uses a typo in the ico parameter, which can lead to a vulnerability. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a loss of funds.",
