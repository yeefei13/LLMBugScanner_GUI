 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and explanations:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `getTokenBalance` function:

The `getTokenBalance` function takes two arguments: `tokenAddress` and `who`. It then uses the `ForeignToken` contract to retrieve the balance of the `who` address in the `tokenAddress` contract. However, the function does not check for integer overflow when calculating the balance, which can lead to incorrect results.

Reason: This vulnerability can occur when the `tokenAddress` contract has a large number of tokens, and the `who` address has a large number of tokens in the `tokenAddress` contract. In this case, the calculation of the balance can overflow, leading to incorrect results.

Function Code:
```
function getTokenBalance(address tokenAddress, address who) constant public returns (uint) {
    ForeignToken t = ForeignToken(tokenAddress);
    uint bal = t.balanceOf(who);
    return bal;
}
```
2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transfer` function:

The `transfer` function takes two arguments: `to` and `amount`. It then checks if the `to` address is not equal to the zero address, and if the `amount` is less than or equal to the balance of the `msg.sender`. However, the function does not check if the `amount` is less than or equal to the balance of the `to` address, which can lead to incorrect results.

Reason: This vulnerability can occur when the `to` address has a balance that is less than the `amount` being transferred. In this case, the transfer will fail, but the function will still return `true`, leading to incorrect results.

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) public returns (bool success) {
    require(_to != address(0));
    require(_amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_amount);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_amount);
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
    return true;
}
```
3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `getTokens` function:

The `getTokens` function takes no arguments. It then uses the `value` variable to determine the amount of tokens to distribute. However, the function does not check if the `value` variable is less than or equal to the `totalRemaining` variable, which can lead to incorrect results.

Reason: This vulnerability can occur when the `value` variable is greater than the `totalRemaining` variable. In this case, the function will distribute more tokens than are available, leading to incorrect results.

Function Code:
```
function getTokens() payable canDistr onlyWhitelist public {
    if (value > totalRemaining) {
        value = totalRemaining;
    }
    require(value <= totalRemaining);
    address investor = msg.sender;
    uint256 toGive = value;
    distr(investor, toGive);
    if (toGive > 0) {
        blacklist[investor] = true;
    }
    if (totalDistributed >= totalSupply) {
        distributionFinished = true;
    }
    value = value.div(100000).mul(99999);
}
```
4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `withdrawForeignTokens` function:

The `withdrawForeignTokens` function takes one argument: `tokenAddress`. It then uses the `ForeignToken` contract to transfer the balance of the `tokenAddress` contract to the `owner` address. However, the function does not check if the `owner` address is the `msg.sender`, which can lead to incorrect results.

Reason: This vulnerability can occur when the `owner` address is not the `msg.sender`. In this case, the `owner` address can transfer the balance of the `tokenAddress` contract to another address, leading to incorrect results.

Function Code:
```
function withdrawForeignTokens(address _tokenContract) onlyOwner public returns (bool) {
    ForeignToken token = ForeignToken(_tokenContract);
    uint256 amount = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    return token.transfer(owner, amount);
}
```
5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `NewIntelTechMedia` constructor:

The `NewIntelTechMedia` constructor takes no arguments. It then sets the `owner` variable to the `msg.sender` address. However, the constructor does not check if the `owner` variable is the `msg.sender`, which can lead to incorrect results.

Reason: This vulnerability can occur when the `owner` variable is not the `msg.sender`. In this case, the `owner` address can be set to another address, leading to incorrect results.

Function Code:
```
function NETM() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
    balances[owner] = totalDistributed;
}
```
