However, if the amount of tokens to be transferred is greater than the sender's balance, the subtraction will result in an integer overflow, which can cause the function to transfer more tokens than the sender is allowed to."

However, the function also subtracts the same amount of tokens from the `master` address, which can cause the function to transfer more tokens than the `master` address is allowed to."

However, the function also sets the `fundingStart` variable to `1501977600`, which is a typo and should be `1501977600000`, which is the correct value. This typo can lead to an attacker being able to transfer more tokens than they are allowed to."
