 Here is the output for the given vulnerability and code:

{
    "output_list": [
        {
            "function_name": "pricePerWei()",
            "auditor_idx" : 0
            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow Vulnerability",
            "criticism": "The function uses integer division to calculate the price of the token in wei, which can lead to integer overflows if the price is too high. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack.",
            "correctness": 9,
            "severity": 9,
            "profitability": 9,
        }
    ]
}

Explanation:

* The function `pricePerWei()` uses integer division to calculate the price of the token in wei, which can lead to integer overflows if the price is too high. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack.
* The criticism for the reasoning and explanation for scoring is that the function uses integer division to calculate the price, which can lead to integer overflows if the price is too high. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a DoS attack.
* The correctness of the function is 9, as it is vulnerable to integer overflows and can be exploited by an attacker to cause a DoS attack.
* The severity of the vulnerability is 9, as it can cause a denial of service attack and is a critical vulnerability.
* The profitability of the vulnerability is 9, as it can be exploited by an attacker to cause a DoS attack and is a critical vulnerability.
