 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and intermediate reasoning:

1. Integer Overflow in `_buy()`:

Function Name: `_buy()`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function _buy() internal returns (uint256 amount) {
    require(buyOpen);
    require(buyPrice>0);
    require(msg.value>0);
    amount = msg.value / buyPrice;
    _transfer(owner,msg.sender,amount);
    BuyToken(msg.sender,buyPrice,amount,msg.value);
    return amount;
}
```
Reason: The `amount` variable is calculated using the `msg.value` and `buyPrice` variables, which are both of type `uint256`. However, the division operation in `amount = msg.value / buyPrice` can result in an integer overflow if the `msg.value` is very large and the `buyPrice` is very small. This can lead to an attacker being able to buy a large number of tokens at a very low price, potentially causing the token to devalue.

2. Wrong Logic in `_sell()`:

Function Name: `_sell()`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function _sell(address _from,uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256 revenue) {
    require(sellOpen);
    require(!frozenAccount[_from]);
    require(amount>0);
    require(sellPrice>0);
    require(_from!=owner);
    _transfer(_from,owner,amount);
    revenue = amount * sellPrice;
    _from.transfer(revenue);
    SellToken(_from,sellPrice,amount,revenue);
    return revenue;
}
```
Reason: The `sellOpen` variable is checked in the `require()` statement, but it is not checked again in the `if` statement. This means that if the `sellOpen` variable is set to `false` after the `require()` statement, the `if` statement will still be executed, potentially causing the token to be sold even though it is not supposed to be.

3. Bad Randomness in `transferEth()`:

Function Name: `transferEth()`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function transferEth(uint256 amount) onlyOwner public {
    msg.sender.transfer(amount*10**uint256(18));
}
```
Reason: The `transferEth()` function transfers a fixed amount of Ether to the owner of the contract, regardless of the amount of Ether that is sent to the contract. This means that the owner of the contract can control the amount of Ether that is transferred, potentially causing the contract to be exploited.

4. Access Control in `freezeAccount()`:

Function Name: `freezeAccount()`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function freezeAccount(address target,bool freeze) onlyOwner public {
    require(target!=owner);
    frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
    FrozenFunds(target,freeze);
}
```
Reason: The `freezeAccount()` function allows the owner of the contract to freeze the account of another user, but it does not check if the target account is frozen before attempting to freeze it. This means that an attacker can freeze the account of another user without the user's consent, potentially causing the user to lose access to their tokens.

5. Typo Constructor in `GrowToken()`:

Function Name: `GrowToken()`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function GrowToken() public {
    owner = 0x757D7FbB9822b5033a6BBD4e17F95714942f921f;
    name = "GROWCHAIN";
    symbol = "GROW";
    decimals = 8;
    totalSupply = 5000000000 * 10 ** uint256(8);
    balanceOf[owner] = totalSupply;
}
```
Reason: The `GrowToken()` constructor sets the `owner` variable to a hardcoded address, but it does not check if the address is valid. This means that an attacker can set the `owner` variable to an invalid address, potentially causing the contract to be exploited.
