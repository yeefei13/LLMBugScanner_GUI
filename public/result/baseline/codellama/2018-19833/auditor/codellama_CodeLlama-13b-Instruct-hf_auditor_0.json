 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `_transfer` Function

Function Name: `_transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {
    require (_to != 0x0);
    require (balanceOf[_from] >= _value);
    require (balanceOf[_to] + _value >= balanceOf[_to]);
    require(!frozenAccount[_from]);
    require(!frozenAccount[_to]);
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;
    emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
}
```
Reason: The `_transfer` function uses the `+=` operator to update the `balanceOf` mapping, which can lead to integer overflow if the balance of the `_from` address is very large. This can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `freezeAccount` Function

Function Name: `freezeAccount`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner public {
    frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
    emit FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
}
```
Reason: The `freezeAccount` function sets the `frozenAccount` mapping to `true` if the `freeze` parameter is `true`, but it does not check if the `target` address is the owner of the contract. This means that any address can freeze the funds of another address, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `burn` Function

Function Name: `burn`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function burn(uint256 _value) onlyOwner public returns (bool success) {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
    totalSupply -= _value;
    emit Burn(msg.sender, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `burn` function uses the `msg.sender` address to determine the amount of tokens to burn. However, this can be exploited by an attacker who can control the `msg.sender` address. This can lead to a loss of funds.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `mintToken` Function

Function Name: `mintToken`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function mintToken(address target, uint256 mintedAmount) onlyOwner public{
    balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;
    totalSupply += mintedAmount;
}
```
Reason: The `mintToken` function can be called by any address, but it only updates the `balanceOf` mapping for the `target` address. This means that the `target` address can mint tokens without the owner's permission, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `constructor` Function

Function Name: `constructor`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
constructor(
    uint256 initialSupply,
    string tokenName,
    string tokenSymbol
) public {
    owner = msg.sender;
    totalSupply = initialSupply * 10 ** uint256(decimals);
    balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    name = tokenName;
    symbol = tokenSymbol;
}
```
Reason: The `constructor` function uses the `msg.sender` address to set the `owner` variable, but it does not check if the `msg.sender` address is the owner of the contract. This means that any address can set the `owner` variable, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

Note: These vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker who can control the `msg.sender` address.
