            "reason": "The mintToken function allows the owner to mint new tokens and increase the total supply of the token. However, the function does not check for integer overflow, which means that if the total supply of the token is increased beyond the maximum value of the uint256 type, the function will overflow and the total supply will become negative."

However, the function does not use a secure random number generator to determine the amount of tokens to mine. If the random number generator is not secure, an attacker can predict the amount of tokens to mine and steal the tokens."

However, the function does not check if the doftManager has the correct permissions to set the prices. If an attacker has the correct permissions, they can set the prices to their advantage."
