 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `_transfer` Function

Function Name: `_transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {
    require(_to != 0x0);
    require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value);
    require(balanceOf[_to] + _value >= balanceOf[_to]);
    uint previousBalances = balanceOf[_from] + balanceOf[_to];
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;
    emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    assert(balanceOf[_from] + balanceOf[_to] == previousBalances);
}
```
Reason: The `balanceOf[_to] + _value` expression in the `require` statement can overflow if the `balanceOf[_to]` value is very large and the `_value` is also very large. This can lead to an unauthorized transfer of tokens from the `_from` address to the `_to` address.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function calls the `_transfer` function with the `msg.sender` address as the `_from` address, which can lead to an unauthorized transfer of tokens from the `msg.sender` address to the `_to` address.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `burn` Function

Function Name: `burn`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function burn(uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);   
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;            
    totalSupply -= _value;                      
    emit Burn(msg.sender, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `burn` function uses the `msg.sender` address to determine the amount of tokens to burn, which can lead to an unauthorized burn of tokens from the `msg.sender` address.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `burnFrom` Function

Function Name: `burnFrom`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function burnFrom(address _from, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value);                
    require(_value <= allowance[_from][msg.sender]);    
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                         
    allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;             
    totalSupply -= _value;                              
    emit Burn(_from, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `burnFrom` function allows any address to burn tokens from another address by calling the `burnFrom` function with the `msg.sender` address as the `_from` address and the `_value` as the amount of tokens to burn. This can lead to an unauthorized burn of tokens from the `_from` address.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `EAI_TokenERC20` Constructor

Function Name: `EAI_TokenERC20` Constructor

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function EAI_TokenERC20(
    uint256 initialSupply,
    string tokenName,
    string tokenSymbol
) public {
    totalSupply = initialSupply * 10 ** uint256(decimals);  
    balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;                
    name = tokenName;                                   
    symbol = tokenSymbol;                               
}
```
Reason: The `EAI_TokenERC20` constructor sets the `totalSupply` variable to `initialSupply * 10 ** uint256(decimals)`, which can lead to an unauthorized minting of tokens.

Note: These vulnerabilities can be exploited in real-world scenarios and can lead to significant financial losses for the affected parties.
