 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and explanations:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) {
    if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < _value) throw;           
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) throw; 
    if (frozenAccount[msg.sender]) throw;                
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;                     
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;                            
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);                   
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `+=` operator to update the `balanceOf` mapping, which can lead to integer overflow if the balance of the sender or the recipient is too large. This can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly, such as allowing a user to transfer more tokens than they actually have.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transferFrom` Function

Function Name: `transferFrom`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    if (frozenAccount[_from]) throw;                        
    if (balanceOf[_from] < _value) throw;                 
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) throw;  
    if (_value > allowance[_from][msg.sender]) throw;   
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                          
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;                            
    allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transferFrom` function uses the `allowance` mapping to check if the sender has enough allowance to transfer the tokens. However, the function does not check if the allowance is greater than the balance of the sender, which can lead to a situation where a user can transfer more tokens than they actually have.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `buy` Function

Function Name: `buy`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function buy() payable {
    if(isSelling == false) throw;
    uint amount = msg.value * buyRate;                  
    balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;                   
    balanceOf[this] -= amount;                         
    Transfer(this, msg.sender, amount);                
}
```
Reason: The `buy` function uses the `msg.value` variable to calculate the amount of tokens to transfer to the sender. However, this variable is not checked for its validity, which can lead to a situation where a user can transfer more tokens than they actually have.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `withdrawToOwner` Function

Function Name: `withdrawToOwner`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function withdrawToOwner(uint256 amountWei) onlyOwner {
    owner.transfer(amountWei);
}
```
Reason: The `withdrawToOwner` function allows any user to withdraw a certain amount of Ether to the owner of the contract. However, this function does not check if the user has the necessary permissions to withdraw the funds, which can lead to a situation where a user can withdraw more funds than they are allowed to.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `GZSToken` Contract

Contract Name: `GZSToken`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Contract Code:
```
contract GZSToken is owned, token {
    uint public buyRate = 46000; 
    bool public isSelling = true;
    mapping (address => bool) public frozenAccount;
    event FrozenFunds(address target, bool frozen);
    function GZSToken(
        uint256 initialSupply,
        string tokenName,
        uint8 decimalUnits,
        string tokenSymbol
    ) token (initialSupply, tokenName, decimalUnits, tokenSymbol) {}
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) {
        if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < _value) throw;           
        if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) throw; 
        if (frozenAccount[msg.sender]) throw;                
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;                     
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;                            
        Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);                   
    }
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
        if (frozenAccount[_from]) throw;                        
        if (balanceOf[_from] < _value) throw;                 
        if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) throw;  
        if (_value > allowance[_from][msg.sender]) throw;   
        balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                          
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;                            
        allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
        Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }
    function mintToken(address target, uint256 mintedAmount) onlyOwner {
        balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;
        totalSupply += mintedAmount;
        Transfer(0, this, mintedAmount);
        Transfer(this, target, mintedAmount);
    }
    function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner {
        frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
        FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
    }
    function setBuyRate(uint newBuyRate) onlyOwner {
        buyRate = newBuyRate;
    }
    function setSelling(bool newStatus) onlyOwner {
        isSelling = newStatus;
    }
    function buy() payable {
        if(isSelling == false) throw;
        uint amount = msg.value * buyRate;                  
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;                   
        balanceOf[this] -= amount;                         
        Transfer(this, msg.sender, amount);                
    }
    function withdrawToOwner(uint256 amountWei) onlyOwner {
        owner.transfer(amountWei);
    }
}
```
Reason: The `GZSToken` contract has a typo in its constructor, which can lead to a situation where the contract is not initialized correctly. This can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly, such as allowing a user to transfer more tokens than they actually have.
