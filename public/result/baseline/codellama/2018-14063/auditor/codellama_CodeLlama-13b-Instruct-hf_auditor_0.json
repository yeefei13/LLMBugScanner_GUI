 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow:

Function: `transfer()`

Vulnerability: Integer overflow in the `balances[_to] + _amount > balances[_to]` check.

Reason: If the `balances[_to]` value is close to the maximum value of a uint256, and the `_amount` value is large, the addition of the two values will result in an integer overflow, which can cause the check to fail even if the transfer should be successful.

2. Wrong Logic:

Function: `transferFrom()`

Vulnerability: Wrong logic in the `allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _amount` check.

Reason: The check should be `allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _amount && balances[_from] >= _amount`, but the provided code only checks the first condition. This can allow an attacker to transfer more tokens than they are allowed to transfer, which can lead to a loss of funds for the owner of the contract.

3. Bad Randomness:

Function: `transferOwnership()`

Vulnerability: Bad randomness in the `transferOwnership()` function.

Reason: The function uses the `transfer()` function to transfer the contract's balance to the new owner, but it does not check if the transfer was successful. This can allow an attacker to take control of the contract by transferring a large amount of tokens to themselves and then calling the `transferOwnership()` function.

4. Access Control:

Function: `changeNameSymbol()`

Vulnerability: Access control issue in the `changeNameSymbol()` function.

Reason: The function allows anyone to change the name and symbol of the contract, but it should only be allowed for the owner of the contract. This can allow an attacker to change the name and symbol of the contract to a value that is not intended by the owner.

5. Typo Constructor:

Function: `Tracto()`

Vulnerability: Typo in the constructor function.

Reason: The constructor function sets the `owner` variable to `msg.sender`, but it should be set to `msg.sender.address`. This can allow an attacker to take control of the contract by setting the `owner` variable to their own address.

Note: These vulnerabilities are exploitable in real-world scenarios and can be beneficial to attackers. It is important to address these vulnerabilities to prevent unauthorized access to the contract and to protect the funds held by the contract.
