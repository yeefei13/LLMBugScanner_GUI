This can lead to a situation where the game is executed with fewer than 6 players, which can cause the distributeFunds function to fail."

However, the keccak256 function is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, and can be predictable. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can predict the outcome of the game, and manipulate the game to their advantage."
