However, if the balance of the sender is very large, the subtraction of the amount being transferred may result in an integer overflow, which can cause the require statement to fail even if the balance is actually sufficient."

However, the keccak256 hash function is not cryptographically secure, and its output is predictable.

However, this function does not check whether the recipient address is a contract or not. This can lead to a vulnerability where an attacker can transfer tokens to a malicious contract and cause the contract to execute arbitrary code."
