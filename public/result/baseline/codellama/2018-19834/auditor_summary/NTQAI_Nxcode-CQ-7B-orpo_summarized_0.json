This can cause the mul() function to return an incorrect result, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract."

This can cause the transfer() function to transfer the wrong amount of tokens to the _to address, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract."

However, the function does not check if the wallet address is the owner of the smart contract, which can lead to an access control vulnerability if an attacker calls the mint() function with a wallet address that is not the owner of the smart contract. This can cause the mint() function to mint tokens to an unauthorized address, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract."

This can cause the quaker() function to set the owner variable to an incorrect address, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract."
