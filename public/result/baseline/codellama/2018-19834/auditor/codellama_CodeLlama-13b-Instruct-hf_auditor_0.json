 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and explanations:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `mul()` Function

Function Name: `mul()`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 c = a * b;
    assert(a == 0 || c / a == b);
    return c;
}
```
Reason: The `mul()` function uses the `*` operator to multiply two `uint256` values, which can lead to an integer overflow if the result is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a `uint256`. This can cause the `mul()` function to return an incorrect result, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `div()` Function

Function Name: `div()`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    assert(b > 0);
    uint256 c = a / b;
    assert(a == b * c + a % b);
    return c;
}
```
Reason: The `div()` function uses the `/` operator to divide two `uint256` values, which can lead to a wrong result if the result is not a whole number. This can cause the `div()` function to return an incorrect result, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `transfer()` Function

Function Name: `transfer()`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(tokenBalances[msg.sender]>=_value);
    tokenBalances[msg.sender] = tokenBalances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
    tokenBalances[_to] = tokenBalances[_to].add(_value);
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transfer()` function uses the `sub()` function to subtract the `_value` from the `tokenBalances[msg.sender]` mapping, which can lead to a bad randomness vulnerability if the `_value` is not a random number. This can cause the `transfer()` function to transfer the wrong amount of tokens to the `_to` address, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `mint()` Function

Function Name: `mint()`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function mint(address wallet, address buyer, uint256 tokenAmount) public onlyOwner {
    require(tokenBalances[wallet] >= tokenAmount);
    tokenBalances[buyer] = tokenBalances[buyer].add(tokenAmount);
    tokenBalances[wallet] = tokenBalances[wallet].add(tokenAmount);
    Transfer(wallet, buyer, tokenAmount);
    totalSupply=totalSupply.sub(tokenAmount);
}
```
Reason: The `mint()` function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to the function to the owner of the smart contract. However, the function does not check if the `wallet` address is the owner of the smart contract, which can lead to an access control vulnerability if an attacker calls the `mint()` function with a `wallet` address that is not the owner of the smart contract. This can cause the `mint()` function to mint tokens to an unauthorized address, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `quaker()` Function

Function Name: `quaker()`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function quaker(address wallet) public {
    owner = msg.sender;
    ownerWallet=wallet;
    totalSupply = INITIAL_SUPPLY * 10 ** 18;
    tokenBalances[wallet] = INITIAL_SUPPLY * 10 ** 18;
}
```
Reason: The `quaker()` function uses the `msg.sender` variable to set the `owner` variable, which can lead to a typo constructor vulnerability if the `msg.sender` variable is not properly initialized. This can cause the `quaker()` function to set the `owner` variable to an incorrect address, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

Note: These vulnerabilities are not exploitable in the provided code, but they can be exploited in real-world scenarios where the smart contract is deployed and used in a production environment.
