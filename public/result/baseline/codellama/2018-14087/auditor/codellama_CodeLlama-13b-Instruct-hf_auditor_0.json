 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and explanations:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `_transfer` Function

Function Name: `_transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {
    require (_to != 0x0);                               
    require (balanceOf[_from] >= _value);               
    require (balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]); 
    require(!frozenAccount[_from]);                     
    require(!frozenAccount[_to]);                       
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                         
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;                           
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
}
```
Reason: The `_transfer` function uses the `require` statement to check if the `_to` address is not equal to `0x0`, which is a valid address. However, the function does not check if the `_value` is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a 256-bit unsigned integer, which can lead to an integer overflow.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `burn` Function

Function Name: `burn`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function burn(uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);   
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;            
    totalSupply -= _value;                      
    Burn(msg.sender, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `burn` function uses the `require` statement to check if the `balanceOf[msg.sender]` is greater than or equal to `_value`. However, the function does not check if the `totalSupply` is greater than or equal to `_value`, which can lead to a wrong logic vulnerability.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `setPrices` Function

Function Name: `setPrices`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function setPrices(uint256 newBuyPrice) onlyOwner public {
    buyPrice = newBuyPrice;
}
```
Reason: The `setPrices` function sets the `buyPrice` variable to the `newBuyPrice` parameter, which can be controlled by an attacker. This can lead to a bad randomness vulnerability, as the attacker can manipulate the `buyPrice` variable to their advantage.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `freezeAccount` Function

Function Name: `freezeAccount`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner public {
    frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
    FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
}
```
Reason: The `freezeAccount` function sets the `frozenAccount` mapping to the `freeze` parameter, which can be controlled by an attacker. This can lead to an access control vulnerability, as the attacker can manipulate the `frozenAccount` mapping to their advantage.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `EncryptedToken` Contract

Function Name: `EncryptedToken`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function EncryptedToken() TokenERC20(INITIAL_SUPPLY, 'EUC', 'EUC') payable public {}
```
Reason: The `EncryptedToken` contract has a typo in the constructor, where the `TokenERC20` constructor is called with the `INITIAL_SUPPLY` parameter, which is a constant, instead of the `totalSupply` parameter, which is a variable. This can lead to a typo constructor vulnerability, as the `INITIAL_SUPPLY` constant is not updated when the `totalSupply` variable is updated.
