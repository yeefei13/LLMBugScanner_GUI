 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow:

Function: `mintTokens`

Vulnerability: Integer overflow in the `mintTokens` function, which can cause the `totalSupply` variable to overflow and become negative.

Reason: The `mintTokens` function adds the `promoValue` to the `totalSupply` variable, which is a uint256. However, if the `promoValue` is too large, it can cause the `totalSupply` variable to overflow and become negative. This can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner.

2. Wrong Logic:

Function: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Wrong logic in the `transfer` function, which can cause the contract to transfer tokens to the wrong address.

Reason: The `transfer` function subtracts the `_amount` from the `balances[msg.sender]` variable, but it does not check if the `balances[msg.sender]` variable is greater than or equal to `_amount`. This can cause the contract to transfer tokens to the wrong address if the `balances[msg.sender]` variable is less than `_amount`.

3. Bad Randomness:

Function: `setPromo`

Vulnerability: Bad randomness in the `setPromo` function, which can cause the contract to set the `promoValue` to a value that is not random.

Reason: The `setPromo` function sets the `promoValue` to a value that is passed as an argument. However, it does not check if the value is random or not. This can cause the contract to set the `promoValue` to a value that is not random, which can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner.

4. Access Control:

Function: `approve`

Vulnerability: Access control in the `approve` function, which can cause the contract to allow unauthorized users to approve transactions.

Reason: The `approve` function checks if the `_amount` is equal to 0, but it does not check if the `_spender` is authorized to approve transactions. This can cause the contract to allow unauthorized users to approve transactions, which can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner.

5. Typo Constructor:

Function: `Play2LivePromo`

Vulnerability: Typo in the constructor function, which can cause the contract to be deployed with a different owner than intended.

Reason: The `Play2LivePromo` function sets the `owner` variable to the `msg.sender` variable. However, it does not check if the `msg.sender` variable is the intended owner of the contract. This can cause the contract to be deployed with a different owner than intended, which can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner.
