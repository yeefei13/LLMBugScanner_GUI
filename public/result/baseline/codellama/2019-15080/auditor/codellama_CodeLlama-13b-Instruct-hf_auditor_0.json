 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(!isblacklistedAccount[msg.sender]);                 
    require(!isblacklistedAccount[_to]);                        
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] > 0);                     
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);                   
    require(_to != address(0));                                 
    require(_value > 0);
    require(balanceOf[_to] .add(_value) >= balanceOf[_to]);     
    require(_to != msg.sender);                                 
    balanceOf[msg.sender] = balanceOf[msg.sender].sub(_value);  
    balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to].add(_value);                
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);                          
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `SafeMath` library to perform arithmetic operations, but it does not check for integer overflows. If the `_value` parameter is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, which can lead to a loss of funds.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transferFrom` Function

Function Name: `transferFrom`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transferFrom(
     address _from,
     address _to,
     uint256 _amount
 ) public returns (bool success)
 {
     if (balanceOf[_from] >= _amount
         && allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _amount
         && _amount > 0
         && balanceOf[_to].add(_amount) > balanceOf[_to])
    {
         balanceOf[_from] = balanceOf[_from].sub(_amount);
         allowed[_from][msg.sender] = allowed[_from][msg.sender].sub(_amount);
         balanceOf[_to] = balanceOf[_to].add(_amount);
         return true;
    } else {
         return false;
    }
}
```
Reason: The `transferFrom` function uses the `SafeMath` library to perform arithmetic operations, but it does not check for integer overflows. If the `_amount` parameter is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, which can lead to a loss of funds. Additionally, the function does not check if the `_from` address has enough funds to transfer, which can also lead to a loss of funds.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `mintTokens` Function

Function Name: `mintTokens`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function mintTokens(uint256 _mintedAmount) public onlyOwner {
    balanceOf[owner] = balanceOf[owner].add(_mintedAmount);
    totalSupply = totalSupply.add(_mintedAmount);
    Transfer(0, owner, _mintedAmount);      
}
```
Reason: The `mintTokens` function does not use a secure random number generator, which can lead to a loss of funds. Additionally, the function does not check if the `_mintedAmount` parameter is too large, which can also lead to a loss of funds.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `burn` Function

Function Name: `burn`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function burn(uint256 _value) public onlyOwner {
    require(_value <= balanceOf[msg.sender]);
    address burner = msg.sender;
    balanceOf[burner] = balanceOf[burner].sub(_value);
    totalSupply = totalSupply.sub(_value);
    Burn(burner, _value);
}
```
Reason: The `burn` function is only accessible to the contract owner, which can lead to a loss of funds if the owner is compromised. Additionally, the function does not check if the `_value` parameter is too large, which can also lead to a loss of funds.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `MorphToken` Constructor

Function Name: `MorphToken` Constructor

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function MorphToken() 
ERC20 (tokenSupply,"MORPH","MORPH") public
{
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```
Reason: The `MorphToken` constructor does not use the `ERC20` constructor correctly, which can lead to a loss of funds. Additionally, the constructor does not check if the `tokenSupply` parameter is too large, which can also lead to a loss of funds.
