 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `_transfer` Function

Function Name: `_transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {
    require (_to != 0x0);                               
    require (balanceOf[_from] >= _value);               
    require (balanceOf[_to] + _value >= balanceOf[_to]); 
    require(!frozenAccount[_from]);                     
    require(!frozenAccount[_to]);                       
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                         
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;                           
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
}
```
Reason: The `_transfer` function uses the `require` statement to check if the `_to` address is not equal to `0x0`, which is a valid address. However, the function does not check if the `_value` is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a 256-bit unsigned integer, which can lead to an integer overflow. This can cause the function to behave unexpectedly and potentially lead to a security vulnerability.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `burn` Function

Function Name: `burn`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function burn(uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);   
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;            
    totalSupply -= _value;                      
    Burn(msg.sender, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `burn` function uses the `require` statement to check if the `balanceOf[msg.sender]` is greater than or equal to `_value`. However, the function does not check if the `totalSupply` is greater than or equal to `_value`, which can lead to a wrong logic vulnerability. This can cause the function to burn more tokens than the total supply, which can lead to a security vulnerability.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `setPrices` Function

Function Name: `setPrices`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function setPrices(uint256 newSellPrice, uint256 newBuyPrice) onlyOwner public {
    sellPrice = newSellPrice;
    buyPrice = newBuyPrice;
}
```
Reason: The `setPrices` function does not use any randomness or entropy to set the `sellPrice` and `buyPrice`. This can lead to a bad randomness vulnerability, as the prices can be easily manipulated by an attacker.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `freezeAccount` Function

Function Name: `freezeAccount`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner public {
    frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
    FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
}
```
Reason: The `freezeAccount` function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to the function. However, the function does not check if the `target` address is a valid address, which can lead to an access control vulnerability. This can cause the function to freeze an invalid address, which can lead to a security vulnerability.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `MyAdvancedToken` Constructor

Function Name: `MyAdvancedToken` Constructor

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function MyAdvancedToken(
    uint256 initialSupply,
    string tokenName,
    string tokenSymbol
) TokenERC20(initialSupply, tokenName, tokenSymbol) public {}
```
Reason: The `MyAdvancedToken` constructor uses the `TokenERC20` constructor to initialize the token. However, the constructor does not check if the `initialSupply`, `tokenName`, and `tokenSymbol` parameters are valid, which can lead to a typo constructor vulnerability. This can cause the constructor to initialize the token with invalid values, which can lead to a security vulnerability.
