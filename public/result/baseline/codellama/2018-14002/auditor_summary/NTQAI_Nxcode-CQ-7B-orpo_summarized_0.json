            "reason": "The `transfer` function uses the `require` statement to check if the `_amount` is greater than 0 and if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the amount. However, this check does not account for the possibility of an integer overflow, where the `_amount` is so large that it overflows the `uint` type and becomes negative. This could allow an attacker to transfer a large amount of tokens from the sender's account to the recipient's account, potentially depleting the sender's balance."

            "reason": "The `approve` function sets the allowance of the sender to the spender to the specified amount. However, this function does not check if the allowance is already set to a non-zero value. This could allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `approve` function with a non-zero amount, potentially allowing the spender to transfer a large amount of tokens from the sender's account to the spender's account."

However, this check does not account for the possibility of a random number attack, where an attacker could repeatedly call the `distribute` function with a large amount of tokens and a random address, potentially depleting the sender's balance."

However, this check does not account for the possibility of an attacker setting the allowance to a large amount and then calling the `transferFrom` function with a small amount. This could allow an attacker to transfer a large amount of tokens from the sender's account to the recipient's account, potentially depleting the sender's balance."

This could allow an attacker to call the constructor with a different address, potentially allowing them to become the owner of the contract."
