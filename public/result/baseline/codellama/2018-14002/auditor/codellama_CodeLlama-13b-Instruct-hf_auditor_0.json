 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint _amount) public returns (bool success) {
    require(_amount > 0 && balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    balances[_to] += _amount;
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `require` statement to check if the `_amount` is greater than 0 and if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the amount. However, this check does not account for the possibility of an integer overflow, where the `_amount` is so large that it overflows the `uint` type and becomes negative. This could allow an attacker to transfer a large amount of tokens from the sender's account to the recipient's account, potentially depleting the sender's balance.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `approve` Function

Function Name: `approve`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function approve(address _spender, uint _amount) public returns (bool success) {
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _amount;
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _amount);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `approve` function sets the allowance of the sender to the spender to the specified amount. However, this function does not check if the allowance is already set to a non-zero value. This could allow an attacker to repeatedly call the `approve` function with a non-zero amount, potentially allowing the spender to transfer a large amount of tokens from the sender's account to the spender's account.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `distribute` Function

Function Name: `distribute`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function distribute(address[] _addresses, uint[] _amounts) public returns (bool success) {
    require(_addresses.length < 256 && _addresses.length == _amounts.length);
    uint totalAmount;
    for (uint a = 0; a < _amounts.length; a++) {
        totalAmount += _amounts[a];
    }
    require(totalAmount > 0 && balances[msg.sender] >= totalAmount);
    balances[msg.sender] -= totalAmount;
    for (uint b = 0; b < _addresses.length; b++) {
        if (_amounts[b] > 0) {
            balances[_addresses[b]] += _amounts[b];
            Transfer(msg.sender, _addresses[b], _amounts[b]);
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `distribute` function uses the `require` statement to check if the total amount is greater than 0 and if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the total amount. However, this check does not account for the possibility of a random number attack, where an attacker could repeatedly call the `distribute` function with a large amount of tokens and a random address, potentially depleting the sender's balance.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `transferFrom` Function

Function Name: `transferFrom`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _amount) public returns (bool success) {
    require(_amount > 0 && balances[_from] >= _amount && allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _amount);
    balances[_from] -= _amount;
    allowed[_from][msg.sender] -= _amount;
    balances[_to] += _amount;
    Transfer(_from, _to, _amount);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transferFrom` function uses the `require` statement to check if the sender's allowance is greater than or equal to the amount. However, this check does not account for the possibility of an attacker setting the allowance to a large amount and then calling the `transferFrom` function with a small amount. This could allow an attacker to transfer a large amount of tokens from the sender's account to the recipient's account, potentially depleting the sender's balance.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `MP3Coin` Constructor

Function Name: `MP3Coin` Constructor

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function MP3Coin() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
    balances[owner] = totalSupply;
    Transfer(this, owner, totalSupply);
}
```
Reason: The `MP3Coin` constructor sets the owner of the contract to the sender of the transaction. However, this constructor does not check if the sender is the owner of the contract. This could allow an attacker to call the constructor with a different address, potentially allowing them to become the owner of the contract.

Note: These vulnerabilities are not exploitable in the provided code, but they could be exploited in a real-world scenario where the contract is deployed and used in a more complex environment.
