 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and explanations:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `buy()` Function

Function Name: `buy()`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function buy() payable public {
    uint amount = msg.value / buyPrice;               
    _transfer(this, msg.sender, amount);              
}
```
Reason: The `buy()` function uses the `msg.value` variable, which is a `uint` type, to calculate the amount of tokens to be transferred. However, if the `buyPrice` variable is set to a very large value, the division operation in the `amount` variable can cause an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect calculation of the amount of tokens to be transferred.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `burn()` Function

Function Name: `burn()`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function burn(uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);   
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;            
    totalSupply -= _value;                      
    Burn(msg.sender, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `burn()` function uses the `require()` statement to check if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the amount of tokens to be burned. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent the sender from burning more tokens than they have. If the sender has a balance of 100 tokens and the amount of tokens to be burned is set to 200, the `require()` statement will pass, and the sender will be able to burn 200 tokens, even though they only have 100 tokens.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `setPrices()` Function

Function Name: `setPrices()`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function setPrices(uint256 newSellPrice, uint256 newBuyPrice) onlyOwner public {
    sellPrice = newSellPrice;
    buyPrice = newBuyPrice;
}
```
Reason: The `setPrices()` function uses the `newSellPrice` and `newBuyPrice` variables to set the prices of the tokens. However, these variables are not checked for validity, and they can be set to any value, including negative values. This can lead to a bad randomness vulnerability, as the prices of the tokens can be set to any value, including values that are not meaningful or that can cause errors in the smart contract.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `freezeAccount()` Function

Function Name: `freezeAccount()`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner public {
    frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
    FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
}
```
Reason: The `freezeAccount()` function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to check if the sender is the owner of the contract. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized users from freezing other users' accounts. If an unauthorized user calls the `freezeAccount()` function with a target address that is not their own, they will be able to freeze that user's account, even if they do not have permission to do so.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `YiTongCoin` Contract

Contract Name: `YiTongCoin`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Contract Code:
```
contract YiTongCoin is owned, TokenERC20 {
    uint256 public sellPrice;
    uint256 public buyPrice;
    mapping (address => bool) public frozenAccount;
    event FrozenFunds(address target, bool frozen);
    function YiTongCoin(
        uint256 initialSupply,
        string tokenName,
        string tokenSymbol
    ) TokenERC20(initialSupply, tokenName, tokenSymbol) public {}
    function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {
        require (_to != 0x0);                               
        require (balanceOf[_from] >= _value);               
        require (balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]); 
        require(!frozenAccount[_from]);                     
        require(!frozenAccount[_to]);                       
        balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                         
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;                           
        Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    }
    function mintToken(address target, uint256 mintedAmount) onlyOwner public {
        balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;
        totalSupply += mintedAmount;
        Transfer(0, this, mintedAmount);
        Transfer(this, target, mintedAmount);
    }
    function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner public {
        frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
        FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
    }
    function setPrices(uint256 newSellPrice, uint256 newBuyPrice) onlyOwner public {
        sellPrice = newSellPrice;
        buyPrice = newBuyPrice;
    }
    function buy() payable public {
        uint amount = msg.value / buyPrice;               
        _transfer(this, msg.sender, amount);              
    }
    function sell(uint256 amount) public {
        require(this.balance >= amount * sellPrice);      
        _transfer(msg.sender, this, amount);              
        msg.sender.transfer(amount * sellPrice);          
    }
}
```
Reason: The `YiTongCoin` contract has a typo in its constructor, which can lead to a vulnerability. The constructor should be named `YiTongCoin()`, but it is currently named `YiTongCoin(uint256 initialSupply, string tokenName, string tokenSymbol)`. This can cause the contract to be initialized with the wrong values, which can lead to errors in the smart contract.
