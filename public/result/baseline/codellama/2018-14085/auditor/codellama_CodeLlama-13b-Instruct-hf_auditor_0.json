 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `sweep` function of the `DefaultSweeper` contract:
```
function sweep(address _token, uint _amount)
    canSweep
    returns (bool) {
        bool success = false;
        address destination = controller.destination();
        if (_token != address(0)) {
            Token token = Token(_token);
            uint amount = _amount;
            if (amount > token.balanceOf(this)) {
                return false;
            }
            success = token.transfer(destination, amount);
        }
        else {
            uint amountInWei = _amount;
            if (amountInWei > this.balance) {
                return false;
            }
            success = destination.send(amountInWei);
        }
        if (success) {
            controller.logSweep(this, destination, _token, _amount);
        }
        return success;
    }
```
Reason: The `amount` variable in the `sweep` function is not checked for integer overflow, which means that if the `amount` is too large, it can cause the `amount` variable to overflow and become a negative value, which can lead to a loss of funds.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `sweep` function of the `DefaultSweeper` contract:
```
function sweep(address _token, uint _amount)
    canSweep
    returns (bool) {
        bool success = false;
        address destination = controller.destination();
        if (_token != address(0)) {
            Token token = Token(_token);
            uint amount = _amount;
            if (amount > token.balanceOf(this)) {
                return false;
            }
            success = token.transfer(destination, amount);
        }
        else {
            uint amountInWei = _amount;
            if (amountInWei > this.balance) {
                return false;
            }
            success = destination.send(amountInWei);
        }
        if (success) {
            controller.logSweep(this, destination, _token, _amount);
        }
        return success;
    }
```
Reason: The `sweep` function in the `DefaultSweeper` contract has a wrong logic. If the `amount` is greater than the balance of the `token`, the function will still try to transfer the `amount` to the `destination`, which can lead to a loss of funds.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `makeWallet` function of the `Controller` contract:
```
function makeWallet() onlyAdmins returns (address wallet)  {
        wallet = address(new UserWallet(this));
        LogNewWallet(wallet);
    }
```
Reason: The `makeWallet` function in the `Controller` contract uses the `address(new UserWallet(this))` expression to create a new wallet, which can lead to a bad randomness vulnerability. The `address` function is not cryptographically secure, and it can be used to predict the address of the new wallet.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `addSweeper` function of the `Controller` contract:
```
function addSweeper(address _token, address _sweeper) onlyOwner {
        sweepers[_token] = _sweeper;
    }
```
Reason: The `addSweeper` function in the `Controller` contract has an access control vulnerability. The function can be called by anyone, including non-owners, which can lead to a loss of control over the sweepers.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `DefaultSweeper` contract:
```
function DefaultSweeper(address controller)
             AbstractSweeper(controller) {}
```
Reason: The `DefaultSweeper` contract has a typo constructor vulnerability. The `AbstractSweeper` constructor is not called correctly, which can lead to a loss of functionality.

Note: These vulnerabilities are exploitable in real-world scenarios and can be beneficial to attackers.
