 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and explanations:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `increaseTotalSupply` function:

Function Name: `increaseTotalSupply`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function increaseTotalSupply (address target,  uint256 increaseBy )  onlyOwner {
    balanceOf[target] += increaseBy;
    totalSupply += increaseBy;
    Transfer(0, owner, increaseBy);
    Transfer(owner, target, increaseBy);
}
```
Reason: The `increaseTotalSupply` function uses the `+=` operator to add the `increaseBy` value to the `totalSupply` variable, which can lead to integer overflow if the `increaseBy` value is too large. This can cause the `totalSupply` variable to become negative, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transferAndFreeze` function:

Function Name: `transferAndFreeze`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transferAndFreeze (address target,  uint256 amount )  onlyAdmin {
    _transfer(msg.sender, target, amount);
    freeze(target, true);
}
```
Reason: The `transferAndFreeze` function first transfers the `amount` of tokens from the `msg.sender` to the `target` address, and then freezes the `target` address. However, if the `amount` is too large, the `target` address may not have enough tokens to freeze, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `sell` function:

Function Name: `sell`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function sell(uint256 amount) returns (uint revenue){
    require(!frozen[msg.sender]);
    if(!usersCanTrade && !canTrade[msg.sender]) {
        require(minBalanceForAccounts > amount/sellPrice);
    }
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount);         
    balanceOf[this] += amount;                        
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;                  
    revenue = amount / sellPrice;
    require(msg.sender.send(revenue));                
    Transfer(msg.sender, this, amount);               
    return revenue;                                   
}
```
Reason: The `sell` function uses the `msg.sender.send(revenue)` function to transfer the `revenue` to the `msg.sender`. However, this function does not check if the `msg.sender` has enough balance to receive the `revenue`, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `withdraw` function:

Function Name: `withdraw`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function withdraw(address target, uint256 amount) onlyOwner {
    target.transfer(amount);
    Withdrawn(target, amount);
}
```
Reason: The `withdraw` function only allows the `owner` to withdraw funds from the smart contract. However, the `target` address is not checked to ensure that it is a valid address, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `GRX` constructor:

Function Name: `GRX`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function GRX() {
    uint256 initialSupply = 20000000000000000000000000;
    balanceOf[msg.sender] = initialSupply ;              
    totalSupply = initialSupply;                        
    name = "Gold Reward Token";                                   
    symbol = "GRX";                               
    decimals = 18;                            
    minBalanceForAccounts = 1000000000000000;
    usersCanTrade=false;
    usersCanUnfreeze=false;
    admin[msg.sender]=true;
    canTrade[msg.sender]=true;
}
```
Reason: The `GRX` constructor sets the `minBalanceForAccounts` variable to `1000000000000000`, which is a large number. However, the constructor does not check if the `msg.sender` has enough balance to set the `minBalanceForAccounts` variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.
