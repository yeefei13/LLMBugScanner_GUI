 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and explanations:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transferMulti` Function

Function Name: `transferMulti`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transferMulti(address[] _to, uint256[] _value) public returns (uint256 amount){
    require(_to.length == _value.length);
    uint8 len = uint8(_to.length);
    for(uint8 j; j<len; j++){
        amount += _value[j]*10**uint256(decimals);
    }
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount);
    for(uint8 i; i<len; i++){
        address _toI = _to[i];
        uint256 _valueI = _value[i]*10**uint256(decimals);
        balanceOf[_toI] += _valueI;
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _valueI;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, _toI, _valueI);
    }
}
```
Reason: The `transferMulti` function uses the `uint8` data type to store the length of the `_to` and `_value` arrays, which can lead to integer overflow when the arrays are too large. This can cause the `require` statement to fail, allowing an attacker to transfer more tokens than they are supposed to.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `freeze` Function

Function Name: `freeze`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function freeze(address _user, uint256 _value, uint8 _step) moreThanZero(_value) onlyController public returns (bool success) {
    _value=_value*10**uint256(decimals);
    return _freeze(_user,_value,_step);
}
```
Reason: The `freeze` function calls the `_freeze` function with the `_value` parameter multiplied by 10^decimals. However, the `_freeze` function does not perform any checks to ensure that the `_value` parameter is within the correct range. This can lead to an attacker being able to freeze a large amount of tokens, potentially causing the contract to run out of tokens.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `generateTokens` Function

Function Name: `generateTokens`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function generateTokens(address _user, uint _amount) onlyController public returns (bool) {
    _amount=_amount*10**uint256(decimals);
    return _generateTokens(_user,_amount);
}
```
Reason: The `generateTokens` function calls the `_generateTokens` function with the `_amount` parameter multiplied by 10^decimals. However, the `_generateTokens` function does not perform any checks to ensure that the `_amount` parameter is within the correct range. This can lead to an attacker being able to generate a large amount of tokens, potentially causing the contract to run out of tokens.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `changeOwner` Function

Function Name: `changeOwner`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function changeOwner(address newOwner) onlyOwner public returns (bool) {
    balanceOf[newOwner] += balanceOf[owner];
    balanceOf[owner] = 0;
    owner = newOwner;
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `changeOwner` function allows any user to call it and change the owner of the contract. However, the function does not perform any checks to ensure that the new owner is a valid user. This can lead to an attacker being able to change the owner of the contract to a malicious user.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `Token` Constructor

Function Name: `Token` Constructor

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function Token(
    uint256 initialSupply,
    string tokenName,
    uint8 decimalUnits,
    string tokenSymbol,
    address _vaultAddress
) public {
    require(_vaultAddress != 0);
    totalSupply = initialSupply * 10 ** uint256(decimalUnits);
    balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    name = tokenName;
    symbol = tokenSymbol;
    decimals = decimalUnits;
    owner = msg.sender;
    vaultAddress=_vaultAddress;
}
```
Reason: The `Token` constructor has a typo in the `decimalUnits` parameter, which should be `decimals`. This can lead to an attacker being able to create a token with the wrong number of decimals, potentially causing the token to be worth less than its face value.
