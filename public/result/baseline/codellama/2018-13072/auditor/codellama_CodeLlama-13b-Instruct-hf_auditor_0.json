 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and intermediate reasoning:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) {
    if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < _value) revert();           
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) revert(); 
    if (frozenAccount[msg.sender]) revert();                
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;                     
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;                            
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);                   
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `+=` operator to update the `balanceOf` mapping, which can lead to integer overflow if the balance of the sender or the recipient is too large. This can cause the contract to revert and lose the transferred tokens.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transferFrom` Function

Function Name: `transferFrom`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    if (frozenAccount[_from]) revert();                        
    if (balanceOf[_from] < _value) revert();                 
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) revert();  
    if (_value > allowance[_from][msg.sender]) revert();   
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                          
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;                            
    allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transferFrom` function uses the `>` operator to check the allowance of the sender, which can lead to wrong logic if the allowance is too large. This can cause the contract to revert and lose the transferred tokens.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `buy` Function

Function Name: `buy`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function buy() payable {
    if(isSelling == false) revert();
    uint amount = msg.value * buyRate;                  
    balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;                   
    balanceOf[owner] -= amount;                         
    Transfer(owner, msg.sender, amount);                
}
```
Reason: The `buy` function uses the `msg.value` variable to calculate the amount of tokens to buy, which can lead to bad randomness if the `msg.value` is not properly validated. This can cause the contract to revert and lose the transferred tokens.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `withdrawToOwner` Function

Function Name: `withdrawToOwner`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function withdrawToOwner(uint256 amountWei) onlyOwner {
    owner.transfer(amountWei);
}
```
Reason: The `withdrawToOwner` function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to the function, but it does not properly validate the `amountWei` parameter. This can cause the contract to revert and lose the transferred tokens.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `Coffeecoin` Contract

Contract Name: `Coffeecoin`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Contract Code:
```
contract Coffeecoin is owned, token {
    uint public buyRate = 4000; 
    bool public isSelling = true;
    mapping (address => bool) public frozenAccount;
    event FrozenFunds(address target, bool frozen);
    function Coffeecoin(
        uint256 initialSupply,
        string tokenName,
        uint8 decimalUnits,
        string tokenSymbol
    ) token (initialSupply, tokenName, decimalUnits, tokenSymbol) {}
    ...
}
```
Reason: The `Coffeecoin` contract uses the `token` constructor to initialize the contract, but it does not properly validate the `initialSupply`, `tokenName`, `decimalUnits`, and `tokenSymbol` parameters. This can cause the contract to revert and lose the transferred tokens.

Note: These vulnerabilities can be exploited in real-world scenarios and can lead to significant financial losses for the contract owners and users.
