            "reason": "The mintedAmount variable is multiplied by 10**18, which can cause an integer overflow if the value of mintedAmount is too large. This can lead to an attacker being able to mint an unlimited amount of tokens, which can devalue the token and lead to a loss of investor confidence."

This can lead to an attacker being able to transfer tokens from the owner's account without their permission."
