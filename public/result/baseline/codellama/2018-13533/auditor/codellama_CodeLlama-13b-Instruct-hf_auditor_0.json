 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and function code:

1. Integer Overflow:

Function Name: `_transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer overflow in the `require` statement that checks the balance of the sender and the receiver.

Function Code:
```
require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value);
require(balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]);
```
Reason: If the balance of the sender is greater than the maximum value of a uint256, the first `require` statement will pass, but the second `require` statement will fail due to the integer overflow. This can lead to a loss of funds for the sender and the receiver.

2. Wrong Logic:

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Wrong logic in the `require` statement that checks if the transfer is allowed.

Function Code:
```
require(_to != 0x0);
require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value);
require(balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]);
```
Reason: The first `require` statement checks if the transfer is allowed, but the second and third `require` statements check if the balance of the sender and the receiver is greater than the maximum value of a uint256. This can lead to a loss of funds for the sender and the receiver.

3. Bad Randomness:

Function Name: `sell`

Vulnerability: Bad randomness in the `require` statement that checks if the transfer is allowed.

Function Code:
```
require(contr.balance >= amount_weis);
```
Reason: The `require` statement checks if the balance of the contract is greater than the amount of weis to be transferred. However, the balance of the contract can be manipulated by the owner of the contract, which can lead to a loss of funds for the sender and the receiver.

4. Access Control:

Function Name: `withdraw`

Vulnerability: Access control vulnerability in the `require` statement that checks if the sender is the owner of the contract.

Function Code:
```
require(msg.sender == owner);
```
Reason: The `require` statement checks if the sender is the owner of the contract, but the owner can be changed by the owner of the contract. This can lead to a loss of funds for the sender and the receiver.

5. Typo Constructor:

Function Name: `ALUXToken`

Vulnerability: Typo constructor in the `ALUXToken` contract.

Function Code:
```
function ALUXToken(
    uint256 initialSupply,
    string tokenName,
    string tokenSymbol
) TokenERC20(initialSupply, tokenName, tokenSymbol) public {}
```
Reason: The `ALUXToken` contract has a typo constructor that calls the `TokenERC20` contract with the wrong number of arguments. This can lead to a loss of funds for the sender and the receiver.

Note: These vulnerabilities are exploitable in real-world scenarios and can be beneficial to attackers.
