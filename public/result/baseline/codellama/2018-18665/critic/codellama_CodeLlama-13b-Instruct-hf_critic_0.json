Explanation:

* The "correctness" score is based on the severity of the vulnerability and the ease of exploitation. In this case, the vulnerabilities are considered high-severity and easy to exploit, so the correctness score is high.
* The "severity" score is based on the potential impact of the vulnerability on the system. In this case, the vulnerabilities have the potential to cause a loss of funds and a security vulnerability, so the severity score is high.
* The "profitability" score is based on the potential financial impact of the vulnerability. In this case, the vulnerabilities have the potential to cause a loss of funds, so the profitability score is high.
* The "auditor_idx" score is based on the auditor's overall assessment of the vulnerability. In this case, the auditor has identified all of the vulnerabilities and has provided detailed criticism for each one, so the auditor_idx score is 0.
