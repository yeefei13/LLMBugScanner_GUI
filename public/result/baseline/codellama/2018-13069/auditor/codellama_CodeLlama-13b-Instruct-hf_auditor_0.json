 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and explanations:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `_transfer` Function

Function Name: `_transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {
    require(_to != 0x0);
    require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value);
    require(balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]);
    uint previousBalances = balanceOf[_from] + balanceOf[_to];
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    assert(balanceOf[_from] + balanceOf[_to] == previousBalances);
}
```
Reason: The `balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]` check in the `_transfer` function is vulnerable to integer overflow. If the `balanceOf[_to]` value is large enough, the addition of `_value` could cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect balance.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `burn` Function

Function Name: `burn`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function burn(uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);   
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;            
    totalSupply -= _value;                      
    Burn(msg.sender, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `burn` function is vulnerable to wrong logic. The function checks if the balance of the sender is greater than or equal to the value to be burned, but it does not check if the total supply is greater than or equal to the value to be burned. This means that if the total supply is less than the value to be burned, the function will still burn the tokens, even though the total supply is not sufficient.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `setPrices` Function

Function Name: `setPrices`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function setPrices(uint256 newSellPrice, uint256 newBuyPrice) onlyOwner public {
    sellPrice = newSellPrice;
    buyPrice = newBuyPrice;
}
```
Reason: The `setPrices` function is vulnerable to bad randomness. The function sets the sell and buy prices to the values passed as arguments, but it does not check if the values are valid or if they are within a certain range. This means that an attacker could set the prices to arbitrary values, potentially causing the contract to malfunction or lose value.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `freezeAccount` Function

Function Name: `freezeAccount`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner public {
    frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
    FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
}
```
Reason: The `freezeAccount` function is vulnerable to access control. The function sets the `frozenAccount` mapping to the value passed as an argument, but it does not check if the caller is the owner of the contract. This means that an attacker could call the function and freeze the account of another user, potentially causing the contract to malfunction or lose value.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `DYC` Contract

Contract Name: `DYC`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Contract Code:
```
contract DYC is owned, TokenERC20 {
    uint256 public sellPrice;
    uint256 public buyPrice;
    mapping (address => bool) public frozenAccount;
    event FrozenFunds(address target, bool frozen);
    function DYC(
        uint256 initialSupply,
        string tokenName,
        string tokenSymbol
    ) TokenERC20(initialSupply, tokenName, tokenSymbol) public {}
    function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {
        require (_to != 0x0);                               
        require (balanceOf[_from] >= _value);               
        require (balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]); 
        require(!frozenAccount[_from]);                     
        require(!frozenAccount[_to]);                       
        balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                         
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;                           
        Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    }
    function mintToken(address target, uint256 mintedAmount) onlyOwner public {
        balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;
        totalSupply += mintedAmount;
        Transfer(0, this, mintedAmount);
        Transfer(this, target, mintedAmount);
    }
    function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner public {
        frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
        FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
    }
    function setPrices(uint256 newSellPrice, uint256 newBuyPrice) onlyOwner public {
        sellPrice = newSellPrice;
        buyPrice = newBuyPrice;
    }
    function buy() payable public {
        uint amount = msg.value / buyPrice;               
        _transfer(this, msg.sender, amount);              
    }
    function sell(uint256 amount) public {
        require(this.balance >= amount * sellPrice);      
        _transfer(msg.sender, this, amount);              
        msg.sender.transfer(amount * sellPrice);          
    }
}
```
Reason: The `DYC` contract is vulnerable to a typo constructor. The contract has a constructor function that takes three arguments, but the constructor function is not properly defined. This means that the contract can be initialized with arbitrary values, potentially causing the contract to malfunction or lose value.
