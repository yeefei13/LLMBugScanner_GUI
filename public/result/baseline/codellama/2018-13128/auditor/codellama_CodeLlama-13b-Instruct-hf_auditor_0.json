 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and intermediate reasoning:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public {
    uint codeLength;
    bytes memory empty;
    assembly {
        codeLength := extcodesize(_to)
    }
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
    if(codeLength > 0) {
        ERC223ReceivingContract receiver = ERC223ReceivingContract(_to);
        receiver.tokenFallback(msg.sender, _value, empty);
    }
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `SafeMath` library to perform arithmetic operations, but it does not check for integer overflows. If the `_value` parameter is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `burn` Function

Function Name: `burn`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function burn(uint _value) public {
    require(_value > 0);
    address burner = msg.sender;
    balances[burner] = balances[burner].sub(_value);
    totalSupply = totalSupply.sub(_value);
    emit Burn(burner, _value);
}
```
Reason: The `burn` function checks that the `_value` parameter is greater than 0, but it does not check that the `_value` parameter is less than or equal to the balance of the burner. If the `_value` parameter is greater than the balance of the burner, it can cause the burner's balance to become negative, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `mint` Function

Function Name: `mint`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function mint(address _holder, uint _value) external {
    require(msg.sender == ico);
    require(_value != 0);
    require(totalSupply + _value <= TOKEN_LIMIT);
    balances[_holder] += _value;
    totalSupply += _value;
    emit Transfer(0x0, _holder, _value);
}
```
Reason: The `mint` function uses the `ico` address to mint new tokens, but it does not check that the `ico` address is authorized to mint new tokens. If an unauthorized address calls the `mint` function, it can cause the token supply to become inflated, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `burn` Function

Function Name: `burn`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function burn(uint _value) public {
    require(msg.sender == ico);
    super.burn(_value);
}
```
Reason: The `burn` function checks that the `msg.sender` is the `ico` address, but it does not check that the `ico` address is authorized to burn tokens. If an unauthorized address calls the `burn` function, it can cause the token supply to become deflated, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `ETY` Constructor

Function Name: `ETY` Constructor

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function ETY(address _ico) public {
    ico = _ico;
}
```
Reason: The `ETY` constructor sets the `ico` address, but it does not check that the `ico` address is authorized to mint new tokens. If an unauthorized address calls the `ETY` constructor, it can cause the token supply to become inflated, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.

Note: These vulnerabilities are not exploitable in the provided code, but they can be exploited if the code is modified or if the contract is deployed on a public blockchain.
