If the maximum number of tickets is set to a large value, the numtickets variable can overflow and accept more tickets than the maximum allowed."

However, the function does not check if the total bounty is greater than the owner's tax, which can cause the contract to pay the winner with a negative amount of tokens."

If the miners are able to manipulate the now variable, they can create a higher probability of accepting tickets than intended."
