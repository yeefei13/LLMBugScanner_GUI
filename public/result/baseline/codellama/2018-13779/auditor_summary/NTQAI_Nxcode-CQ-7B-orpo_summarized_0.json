            "reason": "The `transfer` function uses the `assert` statement to check if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the amount being transferred. However, this check is vulnerable to integer overflow, as the `balanceOf` mapping is of type `uint256`, which can overflow if the balance exceeds the maximum value of `uint256`. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a large amount of tokens to the contract, causing the balance to overflow and potentially leading to a loss of funds."
