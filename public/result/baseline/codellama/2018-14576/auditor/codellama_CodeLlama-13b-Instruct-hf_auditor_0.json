 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    if (block.number < tokenFrozenUntilBlock) throw;    
    if (restrictedAddresses[_to]) throw;                
    if (balances[msg.sender] < _value) throw;           
    if (balances[_to] + _value < balances[_to]) throw;  
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;                     
    balances[_to] += _value;                            
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);                  
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `+=` operator to update the balance of the sender and the recipient. However, this operator can cause an integer overflow if the sum of the balances exceeds the maximum value of a uint256. This can lead to a loss of funds and a security vulnerability.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `approve` Function

Function Name: `approve`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    if (block.number < tokenFrozenUntilBlock) throw;    
    allowances[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;          
    Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);             
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `approve` function sets the allowance of the spender to the value of the `_value` parameter. However, this function does not check if the spender has enough balance to cover the allowance. This can lead to a situation where the spender can spend more tokens than they have, which can lead to a loss of funds and a security vulnerability.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `burnTokens` Function

Function Name: `burnTokens`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function burnTokens(uint256 _amount) onlyOwner {
    if(balances[msg.sender] < _amount) throw;               
    if(supply < _amount) throw;                             
    supply -= _amount;                                      
    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;                        
    Burn(msg.sender, _amount);                              
    Transfer(msg.sender, 0x0, _amount);                     
}
```
Reason: The `burnTokens` function uses the `supply` variable to keep track of the total supply of tokens. However, this variable is not updated when tokens are burned. This can lead to a situation where the total supply of tokens is not accurate, which can lead to a loss of funds and a security vulnerability.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `freezeTransfersUntil` Function

Function Name: `freezeTransfersUntil`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function freezeTransfersUntil(uint256 _frozenUntilBlock, string _reason) onlyOwner {      
    tokenFrozenUntilBlock = _frozenUntilBlock;
    TokenFrozen(_frozenUntilBlock, _reason);
}
```
Reason: The `freezeTransfersUntil` function sets the `tokenFrozenUntilBlock` variable to the value of the `_frozenUntilBlock` parameter. However, this function does not check if the caller has the necessary permissions to set this variable. This can lead to a situation where any user can freeze the transfers of the token, which can lead to a loss of funds and a security vulnerability.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `SunContractToken` Constructor

Function Name: `SunContractToken` Constructor

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function SunContractToken(address _icoAddress) {
    restrictedAddresses[0x0] = true;
    restrictedAddresses[_icoAddress] = true;
    restrictedAddresses[address(this)] = true;
    icoContractAddress = _icoAddress;
}
```
Reason: The `SunContractToken` constructor sets the `restrictedAddresses` variable to a list of addresses. However, the constructor does not check if the addresses are valid. This can lead to a situation where the contract is initialized with invalid addresses, which can lead to a loss of funds and a security vulnerability.

Note: These vulnerabilities are exploitable in real-world scenarios and can be beneficial to attackers. It is important to address these vulnerabilities to ensure the security and integrity of the smart contract.
