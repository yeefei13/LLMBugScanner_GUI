            "reason": "The `function () public payable` function uses a random number generator to determine the payouts. However, the random number generator is not secure, as it uses the `random` function from the Solidity library, which is not cryptographically secure. This means that an attacker can predict the outcome of the game and potentially manipulate the payouts."

The typo is in the `address private owner = 0x5Bf066c70C2B5e02F1C6723E72e82478Fec41201;` line, where the `0x` prefix is missing. This can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to a loss of funds."
