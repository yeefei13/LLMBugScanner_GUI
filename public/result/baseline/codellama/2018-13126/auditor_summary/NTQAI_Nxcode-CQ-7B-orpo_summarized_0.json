            "reason": "The buyTokens function uses the pricePerToken variable to calculate the number of tokens to be minted. However, this calculation is vulnerable to integer overflow, as the pricePerToken variable is a uint256 type, which can hold a maximum value of 2^256-1. If the pricePerToken variable is set to a large value, the calculation of boughtTokens can overflow, leading to an incorrect number of tokens being minted."

            "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
            "reason": "The pausePreSale function is vulnerable to wrong logic because it sets the isPaused variable to true even if the preSaleState variable is not equal to PreSaleState.PreSaleStarted. This can lead to the pausePreSale function being called even if the pre-sale has not started, which can cause the pre-sale to be paused indefinitely."

            "vulnerability": "Bad Randomness",
            "reason": "The withdrawFunds function is vulnerable to bad randomness because it uses the transfer function to send Ether to the _target address. However, the transfer function does not guarantee that the Ether will be sent to the correct address, as it can be intercepted by a malicious actor."

            "vulnerability": "Access Control",
            "reason": "The withdrawFunds function is vulnerable to access control because it allows any address to call the function and withdraw Ether from the contract. However, the function only checks if the msg.sender is the team address, which can be bypassed by a malicious actor."
