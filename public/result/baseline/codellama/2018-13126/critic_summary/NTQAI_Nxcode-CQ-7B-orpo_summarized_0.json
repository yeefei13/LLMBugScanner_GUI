            "criticism": "The buyTokens function uses the pricePerToken variable to calculate the number of tokens to be minted. However, this calculation is vulnerable to integer overflow, as the pricePerToken variable is a uint256 type, which can hold a maximum value of 2^256-1. If the pricePerToken variable is set to a large value, the calculation of boughtTokens can overflow, leading to an incorrect number of tokens being minted.",

This can lead to the pausePreSale function being called even if the pre-sale has not started, which can cause the pre-sale to be paused indefinitely.",
