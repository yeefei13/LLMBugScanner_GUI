 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow:

Function: `mul` in `SafeMath` library

Vulnerability: The `mul` function in the `SafeMath` library uses the `*` operator to multiply two `uint256` values, which can lead to an integer overflow if the result is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a `uint256`.

Reason: This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who sends a large amount of Ether to the contract, causing the `mul` function to overflow and potentially leading to a loss of funds.

2. Wrong Logic:

Function: `transfer` in `BasicToken` contract

Vulnerability: The `transfer` function in the `BasicToken` contract uses the `sub` function from the `SafeMath` library to subtract the transfer amount from the sender's balance, but it does not check if the sender's balance is greater than the transfer amount.

Reason: This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who sends a large amount of Ether to the contract, causing the `transfer` function to underflow and potentially leading to a loss of funds.

3. Bad Randomness:

Function: `GetStats` in `MON` contract

Vulnerability: The `GetStats` function in the `MON` contract uses the `now` function from the Solidity library to get the current timestamp, which can be manipulated by an attacker.

Reason: This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who sends a large amount of Ether to the contract, causing the `GetStats` function to return incorrect information.

4. Access Control:

Function: `mintCoins` in `MON` contract

Vulnerability: The `mintCoins` function in the `MON` contract allows anyone to mint new tokens, which can lead to a loss of control over the token supply.

Reason: This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who sends a large amount of Ether to the contract, causing the `mintCoins` function to mint new tokens and potentially leading to a loss of control over the token supply.

5. Typo Constructor:

Function: `MON` constructor

Vulnerability: The `MON` constructor in the `MON` contract has a typo in the `sumMultiplayer` parameter, which can lead to a loss of funds.

Reason: This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who sends a large amount of Ether to the contract, causing the `MON` constructor to use the wrong value for `sumMultiplayer` and potentially leading to a loss of funds.
