An attacker can send a large amount of tokens to a contract that has a balance of 0x0, causing the contract to overflow and lose all of its tokens."

However, this check is not sufficient to prevent wrong logic attacks.

An attacker can create a contract that inherits from the owned contract and overrides the onlyOwner modifier, allowing them to change the owner of the contract without the original owner's permission."
