            "vulnerability": "Integer overflow",
            "criticism": "The mul function uses the * operator to multiply two uint256 values, which can lead to integer overflow if the result is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a uint256. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack or a loss of funds.",

            "criticism": "The transfer function uses the sub function from the SafeMath library to subtract the _amount from the balances[msg.sender] value, which can lead to integer underflow if the _amount is greater than the balances[msg.sender] value.

            "vulnerability": "Bad randomness",
            "criticism": "The getTokens function uses the div function from the SafeMath library to divide the value by 100000, which can lead to integer division if the value is not a multiple of 100000. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a loss of funds.",

            "vulnerability": "Access control",
            "criticism": "The withdraw function uses the onlyOwner modifier, which means that only the owner of the contract can call this function. However, the function does not check if the owner address is the same as the msg.sender address, which can lead to a situation where an attacker can call the withdraw function and transfer the contract's ether balance to their own address. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a loss of funds.",

            "auditor_idx" : 0
            "vulnerability": "Typo constructor",
            "criticism": "The constructor of the XBORNID contract sets the owner address to the msg.sender address, but the balances[owner] value is set to the totalDistributed value, which is not the correct balance for the owner address. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a loss of funds.",
