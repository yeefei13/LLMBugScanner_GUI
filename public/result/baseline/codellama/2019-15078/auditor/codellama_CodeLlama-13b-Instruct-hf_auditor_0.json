 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and intermediate reasoning:

1. Integer Overflow:

Function Name: `mul`

Vulnerability: Integer overflow in the `mul` function of the `SafeMath` library.

Function Code:
```
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 c = a * b;
    assert(a == 0 || c / a == b);
    return c;
}
```
Reason: The `mul` function uses the `*` operator to multiply two `uint256` values, which can lead to integer overflow if the result is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a `uint256`. This can cause the `assert` statement to fail, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.

2. Wrong Logic:

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Wrong logic in the `transfer` function of the `XBORNID` contract.

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) public returns (bool success) {
    require(_to != address(0));
    require(_amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_amount);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_amount);
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `sub` function from the `SafeMath` library to subtract the `_amount` from the `balances[msg.sender]` value, which can lead to integer underflow if the `_amount` is greater than the `balances[msg.sender]` value. This can cause the `balances[_to]` value to be set to a negative value, which is not allowed in Solidity.

3. Bad Randomness:

Function Name: `getTokens`

Vulnerability: Bad randomness in the `getTokens` function of the `XBORNID` contract.

Function Code:
```
function getTokens() payable canDistr onlyWhitelist public {
    if (value > totalRemaining) {
        value = totalRemaining;
    }
    require(value <= totalRemaining);
    address investor = msg.sender;
    uint256 toGive = value;
    distr(investor, toGive);
    if (toGive > 0) {
        blacklist[investor] = true;
    }
    if (totalDistributed >= totalSupply) {
        distributionFinished = true;
    }
    value = value.div(100000).mul(99999);
}
```
Reason: The `getTokens` function uses the `div` function from the `SafeMath` library to divide the `value` by 100000, which can lead to integer division if the `value` is not a multiple of 100000. This can cause the `mul` function to produce a different result than expected, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.

4. Access Control:

Function Name: `withdraw`

Vulnerability: Access control in the `withdraw` function of the `XBORNID` contract.

Function Code:
```
function withdraw() onlyOwner public {
    uint256 etherBalance = address(this).balance;
    owner.transfer(etherBalance);
}
```
Reason: The `withdraw` function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier, which means that only the owner of the contract can call this function. However, the function does not check if the `owner` address is the same as the `msg.sender` address, which can lead to a situation where an attacker can call the `withdraw` function and transfer the contract's ether balance to their own address.

5. Typo Constructor:

Function Name: `XBornID`

Vulnerability: Typo in the constructor of the `XBORNID` contract.

Function Code:
```
function XBornID() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
    balances[owner] = totalDistributed;
}
```
Reason: The constructor of the `XBORNID` contract sets the `owner` address to the `msg.sender` address, but the `balances[owner]` value is set to the `totalDistributed` value, which is not the correct balance for the `owner` address. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.
