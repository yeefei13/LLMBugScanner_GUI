            "reason": "The sellOffline function uses the remaining variable to keep track of the remaining supply of tokens. However, this variable is not updated correctly when tokens are sold. If the token_amount parameter is large enough, the finalTokens variable will overflow, causing the remaining variable to become negative. This can lead to a situation where the contract can sell more tokens than it has in its supply, which can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner."

            "reason": "The getEthRate function returns the ethRate variable, which is a public variable that can be modified by anyone. However, the function does not check if the caller is the owner of the contract. This means that anyone can modify the ethRate variable, which can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner."

            "reason": "The setTokenPrice function sets the icoTokenPrice variable to a new value, which can be modified by anyone. However, the function does not check if the new value is valid. This means that anyone can set the icoTokenPrice variable to an invalid value, which can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner."

            "reason": "The withdraw function allows anyone to withdraw funds from the contract, but it only checks if the caller is the owner or the backup address. However, the function does not check if the caller has the necessary permissions to withdraw funds. This means that anyone can withdraw funds from the contract, which can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner."

            "reason": "The CERB_Coin constructor sets the totalSupply variable to a large value, but it does not check if the value is valid. This means that anyone can set the totalSupply variable to an invalid value, which can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner. Additionally, the constructor does not check if the owner variable is set correctly, which can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner."
