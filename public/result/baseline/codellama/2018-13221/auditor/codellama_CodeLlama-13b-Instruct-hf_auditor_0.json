 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and explanations:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `mul()` Function

Function Name: `mul()`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function mul(uint a, uint b) internal returns (uint) {
    uint c = a * b;
    assert(a == 0 || c / a == b);
    return c;
}
```
Reason: The `mul()` function uses the `*` operator to multiply two unsigned integers, which can lead to an integer overflow if the result is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by the `uint` type. This can cause the function to return an incorrect result, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `div()` Function

Function Name: `div()`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function div(uint a, uint b) internal returns (uint) {
    assert(b > 0);
    uint c = a / b;
    assert(a == b * c + a % b);
    return c;
}
```
Reason: The `div()` function uses the `/` operator to divide two unsigned integers, which can lead to a wrong result if the result is not a whole number. This can cause the function to return an incorrect result, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `transfer()` Function

Function Name: `transfer()`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
}
```
Reason: The `transfer()` function uses the `sub()` and `add()` functions from the `SafeMath` library to perform arithmetic operations on the `balances` mapping. However, these functions do not provide any randomness or security guarantees, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `transferFrom()` Function

Function Name: `transferFrom()`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) onlyPayloadSize(3 * 32) {
    var _allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender];
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
    balances[_from] = balances[_from].sub(_value);
    allowed[_from][msg.sender] = _allowance.sub(_value);
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
}
```
Reason: The `transferFrom()` function uses the `allowed` mapping to check if the sender has enough allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens. However, this mapping is not properly secured, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `ExtremeToken` Contract

Contract Name: `ExtremeToken`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Contract Code:
```
contract ExtremeToken is Ownable, Extreme {
    string public constant name = "Extreme Coin";
    string public constant symbol = "XT";
    uint public constant decimals = 2;
    uint256 public initialSupply;
    function Extreme () {
        totalSupply = 59347950076;
        balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
        initialSupply = totalSupply;
        Transfer(0, this, totalSupply);
        Transfer(this, msg.sender, totalSupply);
    }
}
```
Reason: The `ExtremeToken` contract has a typo in its constructor function, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the smart contract. The constructor function is named `Extreme()`, but it should be named `ExtremeToken()`.
