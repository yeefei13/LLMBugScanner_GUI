 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow:

Function: transferFrom

Vulnerability: Integer overflow in the calculation of the amount of tokens to transfer.

Reason: The function uses the "+" operator to calculate the amount of tokens to transfer, which can lead to integer overflow if the result exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the uint256 type. This can allow an attacker to transfer a large amount of tokens from the _from address to the _to address, potentially depleting the _from address's balance.

2. Wrong Logic:

Function: transferFrom

Vulnerability: Wrong logic in the calculation of the amount of tokens to transfer.

Reason: The function uses the "+" operator to calculate the amount of tokens to transfer, but the calculation is incorrect. The function should use the "-" operator to calculate the amount of tokens to transfer, but it uses the "+" operator instead. This can lead to an attacker transferring a large amount of tokens from the _from address to the _to address, potentially depleting the _from address's balance.

3. Bad Randomness:

Function: approveAndCall

Vulnerability: Bad randomness in the use of the sha3 function.

Reason: The function uses the sha3 function to generate a random number, but the function does not properly handle the case where the input is not a valid hexadecimal string. This can lead to an attacker controlling the random number generated, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code.

4. Access Control:

Function: approveAndCall

Vulnerability: Insufficient access control in the use of the approve function.

Reason: The function uses the approve function to allow the _spender address to transfer tokens on behalf of the msg.sender address. However, the function does not properly check the allowance of the _spender address, which can allow an attacker to transfer tokens from the msg.sender address to the _spender address without proper authorization.

5. Typo Constructor:

Function: HashnodeTestCoin

Vulnerability: Typo in the constructor function.

Reason: The constructor function sets the totalSupply of the token to 100000000000000000000000000, which is a large number that can lead to integer overflow. This can allow an attacker to create a large number of tokens, potentially devaluing the token.
