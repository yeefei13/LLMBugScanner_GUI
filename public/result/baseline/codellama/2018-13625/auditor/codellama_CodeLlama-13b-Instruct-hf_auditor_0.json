 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions and reasons:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) {
    if (_to == 0x0) revert();
    if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < _value) revert();
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) revert();
    if (frozenAccount[msg.sender]) revert();
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
}
```
Reason: The `balanceOf[_to] + _value` expression in the `transfer` function can cause an integer overflow, which can lead to a loss of funds. This is because the `balanceOf` mapping is of type `uint256`, which can only hold a maximum value of 2^256-1. If the `balanceOf[_to]` value is close to the maximum value, and the `_value` parameter is large, the addition can cause an overflow, resulting in a loss of funds.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transferFrom` Function

Function Name: `transferFrom`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
    if (_to == 0x0) revert();
    if (frozenAccount[_from]) revert();
    if (balanceOf[_from] < _value) revert();
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) revert();
    if (_value > allowance[_from][msg.sender]) revert();
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;
    allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `transferFrom` function has a wrong logic in the `if` statement. The function checks if the `_value` parameter is greater than the `allowance` of the `_from` address, but it should check if the `_value` parameter is greater than or equal to the `allowance`. This can lead to a situation where the function transfers more tokens than the `_from` address has allowed, which can lead to a loss of funds.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `lend` Function

Function Name: `lend`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function lend(address _to, uint256 _value, uint256 _duration_in_days) {
    if (_to == 0x0) revert();
    if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < _value) revert();
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) revert();
    if (frozenAccount[msg.sender]) revert();
    if (_duration_in_days > 36135) revert();
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;
    InterestFreeLending(msg.sender, _to, _value, _duration_in_days);
}
```
Reason: The `lend` function uses a fixed duration of 36135 days, which is not a random value. This can lead to a situation where the function lends tokens for a fixed period of time, which can lead to a loss of funds.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `settlement` Function

Function Name: `settlement`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function settlement(address _from, uint256 _value, address _to, string _notes, string _reference) onlyOwner {
    if (_from == plutocrat) revert();
    if (_to == 0x0) revert();
    if (balanceOf[_from] < _value) revert();
    if (balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to]) revert();
    if (bytes(_reference).length != 66) revert();
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;
    Settlement( _from, _to, _value, _notes, _reference);
}
```
Reason: The `settlement` function has a vulnerability in the access control. The function can only be called by the owner of the contract, but it does not check if the `_from` address is the owner of the contract. This can lead to a situation where a non-owner can call the function and transfer tokens from the owner's address, which can lead to a loss of funds.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `Krown` Contract

Contract Name: `Krown`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Contract Code:
```
contract Krown is owned, token {
    string public nominalValue;
    string public update;
    string public sign;
    string public website;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    uint256 public notificationFee;
    mapping (address => bool) public frozenAccount;
    event FrozenFunds(address target, bool frozen);
    function Krown(
        uint256 initialSupply,
        string tokenName,
        uint8 decimalUnits,
        string tokenSymbol,
        address centralMinter
    ) token (initialSupply, tokenName, decimalUnits, tokenSymbol) {
        if(centralMinter != 0 ) centralAuthority = centralMinter;      
        balanceOf[centralAuthority] = initialSupply;                   
    }
    ...
}
```
Reason: The `Krown` contract has a typo in the constructor. The constructor should be named `Krown`, but it is named `Krown()`. This can lead to a situation where the constructor is not called, and the contract is not initialized properly, which can lead to a loss of funds.
