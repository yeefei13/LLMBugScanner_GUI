 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and intermediate reasoning:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `mul` Function

Function Name: `mul`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (a == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    uint256 c = a * b;
    assert(c / a == b);
    return c;
  }
```
Reason: The `mul` function uses the `*` operator to multiply two `uint256` values, which can lead to an integer overflow if the result is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a `uint256`. This can cause the `assert` statement to fail, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.

Intermediate Reasoning: The `mul` function is used in several places in the contract, including the `transfer` function, which can lead to unexpected behavior if an integer overflow occurs.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `transfer` Function

Function Name: `transfer`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(_to != address(0));
    require(_value <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
    Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
    return true;
  }
```
Reason: The `transfer` function uses the `require` statement to check that the `_to` address is not the zero address, but it does not check that the `_value` is less than or equal to the balance of the sender. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the `_value` is greater than the balance of the sender.

Intermediate Reasoning: The `transfer` function is used in several places in the contract, including the `buyTokens` function, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the `_value` is greater than the balance of the sender.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `convertPresaleTokens` Function

Function Name: `convertPresaleTokens`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function convertPresaleTokens(address buyer, uint256 tokens, uint256 factor, string txHash) external icoAgentOnly returns (uint) {
    require(buyer != address(0));
    require(tokens > 0);
    require(validState());
    uint256 tokensToSell = SafeMath.add(tokensSold, tokens);
    require(tokensToSell <= TOKENS_FOR_SALE);
    tokensSold = tokensToSell;            
    token.mint(buyer, tokens);
    TokenBuyPresale(buyer, tokens, factor, txHash);
  }
```
Reason: The `convertPresaleTokens` function uses the `SafeMath.add` function to add the `tokens` parameter to the `tokensSold` variable, which can lead to an integer overflow if the result is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a `uint256`. This can cause the `require` statement to fail, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.

Intermediate Reasoning: The `convertPresaleTokens` function is used in the `buyTokens` function, which can lead to unexpected behavior if an integer overflow occurs.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `setMigrationMaster` Function

Function Name: `setMigrationMaster`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function setMigrationMaster(address _master) external {
    require(msg.sender == migrationMaster);
    require(_master != 0);
    migrationMaster = _master;
  }
```
Reason: The `setMigrationMaster` function uses the `require` statement to check that the `msg.sender` is the current `migrationMaster`, but it does not check that the `_master` address is not the zero address. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the `_master` address is the zero address.

Intermediate Reasoning: The `setMigrationMaster` function is used in the `finishIco` function, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the `_master` address is the zero address.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `SPXToken` Constructor

Function Name: `SPXToken` Constructor

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Function Code:
```
function SPXToken(address _ico, address _migrationMaster) public {
    require(_ico != 0);
    ico = _ico;
    migrationMaster = _migrationMaster;
  }
```
Reason: The `SPXToken` constructor uses the `require` statement to check that the `_ico` address is not the zero address, but it does not check that the `_migrationMaster` address is not the zero address. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the `_migrationMaster` address is the zero address.

Intermediate Reasoning: The `SPXToken` constructor is used in the `SpadeIco` constructor, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the `_migrationMaster` address is the zero address.
