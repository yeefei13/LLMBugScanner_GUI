 Here are the 5 most severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract, along with their associated functions, reasons, and explanations:

1. Integer Overflow Vulnerability in the `_transfer` Function

Function Name: `_transfer`

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow

Function Code:
```
function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {
    require(_to != 0x0);
    require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value);
    require(balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]);
    uint previousBalances = balanceOf[_from] + balanceOf[_to];
    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;
    Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    assert(balanceOf[_from] + balanceOf[_to] == previousBalances);
}
```
Reason: The `balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]` check in the `_transfer` function is vulnerable to integer overflow. If the `balanceOf[_to]` value is large enough, the addition of `_value` could cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect balance.

2. Wrong Logic Vulnerability in the `burn` Function

Function Name: `burn`

Vulnerability: Wrong Logic

Function Code:
```
function burn(uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);   
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;            
    totalSupply -= _value;                      
    Burn(msg.sender, _value);
    return true;
}
```
Reason: The `burn` function is vulnerable to wrong logic. The function checks if the balance of the sender is greater than or equal to the value to be burned, but it does not check if the total supply is greater than or equal to the value to be burned. This means that if the total supply is less than the value to be burned, the function will still burn the tokens, even though the total supply is not sufficient.

3. Bad Randomness Vulnerability in the `approveAndCall` Function

Function Name: `approveAndCall`

Vulnerability: Bad Randomness

Function Code:
```
function approveAndCall(address _spender, uint256 _value, bytes _extraData)
    public
    returns (bool success) {
    tokenRecipient spender = tokenRecipient(_spender);
    if (approve(_spender, _value)) {
        spender.receiveApproval(msg.sender, _value, this, _extraData);
        return true;
    }
}
```
Reason: The `approveAndCall` function is vulnerable to bad randomness. The function uses the `approve` function to approve the spender, but it does not check if the approval was successful. If the approval fails, the function will still call the `receiveApproval` function on the spender, which could result in unexpected behavior.

4. Access Control Vulnerability in the `freezeAccount` Function

Function Name: `freezeAccount`

Vulnerability: Access Control

Function Code:
```
function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner public {
    frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
    FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
}
```
Reason: The `freezeAccount` function is vulnerable to access control. The function checks if the caller is the owner, but it does not check if the target account is frozen. This means that any account can call the function and freeze any other account, even if it is not the owner.

5. Typo Constructor Vulnerability in the `MyAdvancedToken` Contract

Contract Name: `MyAdvancedToken`

Vulnerability: Typo Constructor

Contract Code:
```
contract MyAdvancedToken is owned, TokenERC20 {
    uint256 public sellPrice;
    uint256 public buyPrice;
    mapping (address => bool) public frozenAccount;
    event FrozenFunds(address target, bool frozen);
    function MyAdvancedToken(
        uint256 initialSupply,
        string tokenName,
        string tokenSymbol
    ) TokenERC20(initialSupply, tokenName, tokenSymbol) public {}
    function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {
        require (_to != 0x0);                               
        require (balanceOf[_from] >= _value);               
        require (balanceOf[_to] + _value >= balanceOf[_to]); 
        require(!frozenAccount[_from]);                     
        require(!frozenAccount[_to]);                       
        balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                         
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;                           
        Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    }
    function mintToken(address target, uint256 mintedAmount) onlyOwner public {
        balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;
        totalSupply += mintedAmount;
        Transfer(0, this, mintedAmount);
        Transfer(this, target, mintedAmount);
    }
    function freezeAccount(address target, bool freeze) onlyOwner public {
        frozenAccount[target] = freeze;
        FrozenFunds(target, freeze);
    }
    function setPrices(uint256 newSellPrice, uint256 newBuyPrice) onlyOwner public {
        sellPrice = newSellPrice;
        buyPrice = newBuyPrice;
    }
    function buy() payable public {
        uint amount = msg.value / buyPrice;               
        _transfer(this, msg.sender, amount);              
    }
    function sell(uint256 amount) public {
        require(this.balance >= amount * sellPrice);      
        _transfer(msg.sender, this, amount);              
        msg.sender.transfer(amount * sellPrice);          
    }
}
```
Reason: The `MyAdvancedToken` contract is vulnerable to a typo constructor. The contract has a constructor that takes 3 parameters, but it does not check if the parameters are valid. This means that any user can call the constructor with invalid parameters, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Note: These vulnerabilities are not exploitable in the real world, but they are still important to address in order to ensure the security and reliability of the smart contract.
