Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "transfer",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function transfers funds from a sender to a receiver. If the value is larger than the balance, it will cause an integer overflow, allowing the attacker to transfer more funds than the account actually owns.",
      "correctness": 0,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 9
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Access Control",
      "criticism": "The function transfers funds from a sender to a receiver. The Access Control vulnerability allows an attacker to transfer funds from an account to another account, even if the attacker does not have permission to do so.",
      "correctness": 0,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the output is the same as the input because all vulnerabilities have a correctness value of 0.
