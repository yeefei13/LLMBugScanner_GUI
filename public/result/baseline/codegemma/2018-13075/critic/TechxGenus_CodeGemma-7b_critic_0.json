{"function_name":"CarbonExchangeCoinToken","auditor_idx":0,"vulnerability":"Integer Overflow","criticism":"The function relies on the underlying balance of the contract, which could be manipulated leading to a potential overflow. This could be exploited by a potential attacker to transfer funds to other addresses.","correctness":3,"severity":3,"profitability":3,"function_name":"CarbonExchangeCoinToken","auditor_idx":0,"vulnerability":"Wrong Logic","criticism":"The logic within the if statement is incorrect. The condition should be a 'greater than or equal to' rather than a 'greater than'. This could be exploited by a potential attacker to transfer funds to other addresses.","correctness":2,"severity":2,"profitability":2,"function_name":"CarbonExchangeCoinToken","auditor_idx":0,"vulnerability":"Bad Randomness","criticism":"The random number generator used within the contract is not declared as a modifier. This could be exploited by a potential attacker to manipulate the supply of tokens within the contract.","correctness":2,"severity":2,"profitability":2,"function_name":"CarbonExchangeCoinToken","auditor_idx":0,"vulnerability":"Access Control","criticism":"The access control for the function to freeze account is not properly set. It could be exploited by a potential attacker to freeze account of any address.","correctness":3,"severity":3,"profitability":3,"function_name":"CarbonExchangeCoinToken","auditor_idx":0,"vulnerability":"Typo Constructor","criticism":"The contract's constructor is not properly secured. It could be exploited by a potential attacker to manipulate the contract's owner.","correctness":2,"severity":2,"profitability":2,"function_name":"CarbonExchangeCoinToken","auditor_idx":0,"vulnerability":"Token Devalue","criticism":"The token's supply is not properly secured. It could be exploited by a potential attacker to manipulate the value of tokens within the contract.","correctness":2,"severity":2,"profitability":2}<eos>
