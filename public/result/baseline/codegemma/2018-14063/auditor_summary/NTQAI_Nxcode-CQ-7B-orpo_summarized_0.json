            "reason": "The function 'transfer' is vulnerable to integer overflow. If the value of the transaction is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable, it will cause an overflow, which can lead to incorrect results and potential exploitation by attackers."

            "reason": "The function 'increaseApproval' has a wrong logic. It always increases the allowance regardless of the value of `_addedValue`. This can lead to potential exploitation by attackers as it ignores the input validation."

This can lead to potential exploitation by attackers if they manage to transfer funds from valid accounts to invalid or malicious accounts."

The function does not require a constructor to be called, but it does not check if the `_spender` address is the same as the contract address. This can lead to potential exploitation by attackers if they manage to call the function with a malicious `_spender` address."

This can lead to potential exploitation by attackers if they manage to decrease the allowance below zero or force the contract to accept a lower value."
