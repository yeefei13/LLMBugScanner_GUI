This can be exploited by transferring a large amount of tokens to an address and then trying to transfer more, which will cause an integer overflow and revert the transaction. This can be mitigated by adding checks in the `sub` function to see if the result of the subtraction will cause an overflow.",

            "criticism": "The function `enablePurchasing` in the `Virgo_ZodiacToken` contract only has one line of code to set the purchasing status. This can be exploited by calling this function multiple times until the purchasing status becomes true. This can be mitigated by adding a delay or a counter check in the `enablePurchasing` function to prevent this.",
