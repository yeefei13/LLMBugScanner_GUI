      "function_name": "sub",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The `sub` function in the `Virgo_ZodiacToken` contract lacks checks for signed integer overflow. This can be exploited by transferring a large amount of tokens to an address and then attempting to transfer more, which will cause an integer overflow and revert the transaction. To mitigate this, the function should include checks to prevent overflow.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This output contains only the vulnerability with the highest severity, which is "Integer Overflow".
