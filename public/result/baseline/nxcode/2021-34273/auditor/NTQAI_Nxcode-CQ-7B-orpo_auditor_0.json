            "reason": "The distributeToken function is vulnerable to integer overflow. The function subtracts _value from the sender's balance and adds it to the recipient's balance. If the sender's balance is less than _value, the function will underflow and the recipient's balance will be increased by a negative amount. This can lead to a loss of funds for the sender and potentially a loss of funds for the recipient. The fix is to add a check to ensure that the sender's balance is greater than or equal to _value before subtracting _value from the sender's balance."

            "reason": "The B2X contract has a fixed total supply of 21 * 10 ** 14 tokens. This means that the token will devalue over time as the total supply is fixed.

This means that the contract owner has complete control over the tokens and can mint new tokens as needed.

            "reason": "The B2X contract has a constructor that sets the total supply of tokens to 21 * 10 ** 14 and assigns all of the tokens to the contract owner. This is a wrong logic as the total supply of tokens should be fixed and not determined by the contract owner. The fix is to remove the constructor and add a fixed total supply to the contract. This can be achieved by using a constant variable to store the total supply and initializing the contract with the fixed total supply."
