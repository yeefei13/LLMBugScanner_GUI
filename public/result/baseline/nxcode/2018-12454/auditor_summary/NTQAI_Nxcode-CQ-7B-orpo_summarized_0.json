            "reason": "The function setBettingCondition takes two parameters: _contenders and _bettingprice. The value of _contenders is assigned to arraysize, but there is no check to ensure that arraysize does not exceed 1000. This could lead to an integer overflow if _contenders is greater than 1000. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause the contract to behave unexpectedly or to steal funds from the contract."

The function _addguess increments the value of numguesses by 1. However, there is no check to ensure that numguesses does not exceed the maximum value of 1000. This could lead to an integer overflow if the number of guesses exceeds 1000. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause the contract to behave unexpectedly or to steal funds from the contract."
