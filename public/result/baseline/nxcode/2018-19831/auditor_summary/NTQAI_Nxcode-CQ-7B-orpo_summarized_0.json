            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "reason": "The function Mining24 takes two parameters, _value and _minReq, which are both uint256. The function then assigns these values to the respective variables. However, there is no check to ensure that the sum of _value and totalDistributed does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256. This could lead to an integer overflow, where the value of totalDistributed is increased beyond its maximum value, causing the contract to behave unexpectedly or fail. This vulnerability is exploitable in real-world scenarios, as it allows attackers to cause the contract to behave in unintended ways by manipulating the totalDistributed variable."

The function then calculates the amount of tokens to give to the investor based on the value parameter and the minimum required value. However, there is no check to ensure that the sum of value and totalDistributed does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256.
