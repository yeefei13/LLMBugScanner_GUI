However, there is no check to ensure that the sum of _value and totalDistributed does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256. This could lead to an integer overflow, where the value of totalDistributed is increased beyond its maximum value, causing the contract to behave unexpectedly or fail. This vulnerability is exploitable in real-world scenarios, as it allows attackers to cause the contract to behave in unintended ways by manipulating the totalDistributed variable."
