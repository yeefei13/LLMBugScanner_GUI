Here is the output in JSON format:

As you can see, all the vulnerabilities have a severity of 8 and a profitability of 6, which means they are all of the same severity level. If you want to sort them by severity, you can use a JSON processing library like `json.loads()` and `json.dumps()` in Python, or a similar function in your programming language of choice.
