It first calculates the tokenAmount by multiplying the msg.value with the rate and dividing it by 1 ether. If the calculated tokenAmount is less than 0, the function reverts. Then, it checks if the totalSupply is greater than 999999, and if so, it reverts. Then, it sets the rate based on the totalSupply.
