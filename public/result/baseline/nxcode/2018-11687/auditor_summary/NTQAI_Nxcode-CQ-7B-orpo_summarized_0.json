            "reason": "The totalSupply function is a constant function that returns the total supply of tokens. However, the variable _totalSupply is declared as a uint256, which means it can hold values up to 2^256 - 1. If the total supply of tokens exceeds this limit, an integer overflow will occur, leading to incorrect results and potentially loss of funds. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who manipulates the total supply of tokens to exceed the maximum limit."

However, the variable balances is a mapping that stores the balance of tokens for each address. If an address holds a balance that exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256, an integer overflow will occur, leading to incorrect results and potentially loss of funds. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who manipulates the balances of tokens held by an address to exceed the maximum limit."

However, the variable balances is a mapping that stores the balance of tokens for each address. If the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the amount being transferred, and the recipient's balance plus the amount being transferred does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256, an integer overflow will occur, leading to incorrect results and potentially loss of funds. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who manipulates the balances of tokens held by the sender and recipient to exceed the maximum limit."
