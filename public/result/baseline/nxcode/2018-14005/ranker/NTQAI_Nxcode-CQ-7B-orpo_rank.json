      "criticism": "The constructor of the contract is vulnerable to access control. The contract owner is hardcoded to 0x79574f4474ba144820798ccaebb779fe8c8029d0. This means that anyone can call the constructor and set the owner to any address. This can lead to unauthorized ownership transfers and potentially other security issues. The fix is to use a modifier to restrict the constructor to only be called by the contract owner.",
