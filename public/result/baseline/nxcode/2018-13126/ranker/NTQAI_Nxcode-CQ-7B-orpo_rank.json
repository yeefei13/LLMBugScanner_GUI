Here is the output in JSON format:

      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The buyTokens() function has a wrong logic. It does not check if the preSaleState is PreSaleStarted before incrementing the totalSupply. This can be exploited by an attacker to buy more tokens than they can afford.",

      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The buyTokens() function has a wrong logic. It does not check if the isPaused is false before incrementing the totalSupply. This can be exploited by an attacker to buy more tokens than they can afford.",
      "correctness": 6,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the output is the same as the input, as there are no vulnerabilities with a correctness value of 0.
