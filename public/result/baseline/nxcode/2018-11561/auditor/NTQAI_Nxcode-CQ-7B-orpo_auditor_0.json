            "reason": "The distributeToken function is vulnerable to integer overflow. The function subtracts _value from the sender's balance and adds it to the recipient's balance. If the sender's balance is less than _value, the function will underflow and the recipient's balance will be increased by a negative amount. This can lead to a loss of funds for the sender and potentially a loss of funds for the recipient. The fix is to add a check to ensure that the sender's balance is greater than or equal to _value before subtracting _value from the sender's balance."
