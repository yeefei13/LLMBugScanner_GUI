This can lead to an underflow if the sender's balance is less than the transfer amount. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who sends a large amount of tokens to a contract with a low balance, causing the contract to revert and lose the tokens. The fix is to add a check for integer overflow before performing the subtraction and addition operations."
