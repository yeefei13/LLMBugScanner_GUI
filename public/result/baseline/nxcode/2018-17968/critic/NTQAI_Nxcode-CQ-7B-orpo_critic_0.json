However, the `keccak256` function is not suitable for generating random numbers. The `keccak256` function is deterministic and can be predicted by attackers. This vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user who predicts the random number and enters the room at the right time. The solution is to use a more secure random number generator, such as `random.org` or `chainlink`. Additionally, the contract should have a mechanism to prevent the use of the same random number multiple times. This can be achieved by storing the last random number generated and checking if the current random number is the same as the last one. If it is, the contract should generate a new random number.",
