Here is the output in JSON format:

      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The totalSupply variable is multiplied by 10 ** uint256(decimals) which can cause an integer overflow if the initialSupply is too large. This can be exploited by an attacker to mint more tokens than the total supply.",

As you can see, the input JSON has been processed to remove any vulnerabilities with a correctness value of 0. The vulnerabilities are then sorted by severity in descending order, and the top 5 most severe vulnerabilities are outputted in JSON format.
