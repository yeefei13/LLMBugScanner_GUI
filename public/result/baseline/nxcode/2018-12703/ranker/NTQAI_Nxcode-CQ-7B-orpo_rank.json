Here is the output in JSON format:

      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The allowance function does not check for integer overflow. If the allowance of an address is greater than the maximum value of uint256, the function will return an incorrect result.

      "correctness": 9,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, all the vulnerabilities have a severity of 9, which is the highest possible severity. Therefore, the output is the same as the input.
