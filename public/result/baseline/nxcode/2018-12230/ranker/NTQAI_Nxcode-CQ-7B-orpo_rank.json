      "vulnerability": "Access Control",
      "criticism": "The mintToken function is only accessible to the contract owner. This means that only the contract owner can mint tokens, which can be exploited by an attacker to mint tokens without the owner's permission.",

      "vulnerability": "Typo Constructor",
      "criticism": "The function name is misspelled as 'mintToken' instead of 'mintTokens'. This can lead to confusion and potential misuse of the function. This can be exploited by an attacker to call the wrong function.",
