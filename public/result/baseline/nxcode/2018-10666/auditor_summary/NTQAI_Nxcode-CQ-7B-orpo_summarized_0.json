            "reason": "The function `feeFor` calculates the fee based on the amount of IDXM held by the recipient. If the recipient has held for less than `mustHoldFor` seconds, the fee is calculated as `amount * fee * (singleIDXMQty - amountHeld) / feeDivisor`. However, if the recipient has held for more than `mustHoldFor` seconds, the fee is calculated as `amount * fee / baseFeeDivisor`. This calculation can cause an integer overflow if the recipient has held for a very long time and the amount of IDXM held is very large. This can be exploited by an attacker to steal more IDXM from the recipient than they actually hold."
