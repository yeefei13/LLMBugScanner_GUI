However, there is a potential integer overflow vulnerability in this function. The issue lies in the fact that the function does not check if the transfer amount exceeds the balance of the sender before subtracting it from the sender's balance. This can result in an integer overflow if the sender has a balance of zero and tries to transfer a value greater than zero.",
