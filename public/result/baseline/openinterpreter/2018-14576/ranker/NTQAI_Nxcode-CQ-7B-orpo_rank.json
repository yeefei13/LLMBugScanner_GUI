This can lead to incorrect access control and potential security vulnerabilities. To fix this, the line `restrictedAddresses[0x0] = true;` should be changed to `restrictedAddresses[_icoAddress] = true;` to correctly initialize the `restrictedAddresses` mapping with the address of the ICO contract.",
