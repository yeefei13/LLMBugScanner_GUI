However, there is no check to ensure that the total supply does not exceed the maximum value of `uint256`. This can lead to an integer overflow, potentially causing the contract to behave unpredictably."

However, there is a check that ensures the recipient address is not zero and that the balance of the recipient is not greater than the maximum value of `uint256`. This logic is incorrect as it allows for an overflow if the recipient's balance is already at its maximum value."
