However, there is no check to ensure that the new total supply does not exceed the maximum value of `uint256`. This can lead to an integer overflow vulnerability."

If `disabled` is set to `true`, the transfer should not be allowed. However, in the current implementation, the condition is reversed, leading to a wrong logic."
