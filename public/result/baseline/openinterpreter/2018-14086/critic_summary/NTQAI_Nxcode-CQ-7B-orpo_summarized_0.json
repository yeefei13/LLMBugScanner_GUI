The balanceOf[_to] + _value < balanceOf[_to] condition checks if the sum of the current balance of the recipient and the value being transferred is less than the current balance of the recipient. If the sum is less than the current balance, it means that the balanceOf[_to] value will be negative, which is not allowed in the contract. This can be exploited by an attacker to transfer more tokens than the contract allows.",
