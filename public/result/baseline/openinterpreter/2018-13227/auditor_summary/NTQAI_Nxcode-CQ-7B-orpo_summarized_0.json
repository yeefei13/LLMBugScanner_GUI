            "function_name": "transfer",
            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "reason": "The integer overflow vulnerability arises when the sum of `balanceOf[_to]` and `_value` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the `uint256` data type. This can result in incorrect token balances and potential loss of funds."
        },

            "function_name": "transferFrom",
            "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
            "reason": "The wrong logic in the `transferFrom` function can lead to incorrect token balances and potential loss of funds. If the `_value` parameter is greater than the sender's balance, it can result in a negative balance for the sender."
        },
        {
            "function_name": "setPrices",
            "vulnerability": "Bad Randomness",
            "reason": "The lack of randomness in the `setPrices` function can make the contract's behavior predictable and potentially unfair. If the `newSellPrice` and `newBuyPrice` parameters are not derived from a random source, the contract's pricing can be manipulated by the owner, leading to unfair trading conditions."

            "function_name": "mintToken",
            "vulnerability": "Access Control",
            "reason": "The lack of access control in the `mintToken` function can result in unauthorized minting of tokens and potential loss of funds. If the `onlyOwner` modifier is not used to restrict the minting of tokens, anyone can call the function and mint new tokens, which can be a security risk."

            "function_name": "MoneyChainNetToken",
            "vulnerability": "Typo Constructor",
            "reason": "The typo in the constructor function name can lead to confusion and potential errors in the contract's initialization. If the function name is not spelled correctly, it can result in incorrect behavior and potential contract failures."
