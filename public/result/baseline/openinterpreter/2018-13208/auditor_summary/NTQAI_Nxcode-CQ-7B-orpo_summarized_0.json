If the balance of the sender is less than the value to be transferred, the subtraction operation will result in an underflow, leading to incorrect calculations.

The mintedAmount is added to the balance of the target address, which can lead to a potential overflow if the totalSupply is already at its maximum value.

If the owner's address is compromised, attackers can call this function to set arbitrary sell and buy prices, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation."
