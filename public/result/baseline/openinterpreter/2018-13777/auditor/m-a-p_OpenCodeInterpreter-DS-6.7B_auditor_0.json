Based on the provided smart contract code, there are several vulnerabilities that can be identified. Here are the five most severe vulnerabilities:

1. Integer Overflow:
   - Function Name: `_transfer`
   - Vulnerability: The function `_transfer` in the `TokenERC20` contract allows for the transfer of tokens from one address to another. However, there is a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the function.
   - Function Code:
     ```
     function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {
         require(_to != 0x0);
         require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value);
         require(balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]);
         uint previousBalances = balanceOf[_from] + balanceOf[_to];
         balanceOf[_from] -= _value;
         balanceOf[_to] += _value;
         Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
         assert(balanceOf[_from] + balanceOf[_to] == previousBalances);
     }
     ```
   - Reason: In the `_transfer` function, the sum of `balanceOf[_from]` and `balanceOf[_to]` is calculated before and after the transfer. If the sum of `balanceOf[_from]` and `_value` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the `uint` data type, an integer overflow error will occur.

2. Wrong Logic:
   - Function Name: `transferFrom`
   - Vulnerability: The `transferFrom` function in the `TokenERC20` contract allows for the transfer of tokens from one address to another. However, there is a potential wrong logic vulnerability in the function.
   - Function Code:
     ```
     function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
         require(_value <= allowance[_from][msg.sender]);     
         allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
         _transfer(_from, _to, _value);
         return true;
     }
     ```
   - Reason: In the `transferFrom` function, the `_value` parameter is compared to the `allowance[_from][msg.sender]` value. If `_value` is greater than the allowance, it will result in an underflow error. This can lead to incorrect token transfers.

3. Bad Randomness:
   - Function Name: N/A
   - Vulnerability: The provided smart contract does not seem to have any functions that involve randomness. However, it is important to note that randomness can be used in smart contracts to enhance security, but improper handling of randomness can lead to vulnerabilities.

4. Access Control:
   - Function Name: `mintToken`
   - Vulnerability: The `mintToken` function in the `RRToken` contract allows for the minting of new tokens. However, there is a potential access control vulnerability in the function.
   - Function Code:
     ```
     function mintToken(address target, uint256 mintedAmount) onlyOwner public {
         balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;
         totalSupply += mintedAmount;
         Transfer(0, this, mintedAmount);
         Transfer(this, target, mintedAmount);
     }
     ```
   - Reason: In the `mintToken` function, the `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to the function. However, there is no mechanism in place to prevent the owner from transferring ownership to another address. This can lead to unauthorized token transfers.

5. Typo Constructor:
   - Function Name: `RRToken`
   - Vulnerability: The `RRToken` constructor in the `RRToken` contract has a typo in the function name. The function name should be `RRToken()` instead of `RRToken`.
   - Function Code:
     ```
     function RRToken() TokenERC20(initialSupply, tokenName, tokenSymbol) public {}
     ```
   - Reason: The constructor function name should match the contract name. In this case, the constructor should be named `RRToken()` instead of `RRToken`.

Please note that these vulnerabilities are exploitable in real-world scenarios and can be exploited by attackers to manipulate the smart contract's behavior. It is important to address these vulnerabilities and implement appropriate security measures to protect the smart contract from potential attacks.
