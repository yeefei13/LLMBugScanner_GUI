The `_value` is subtracted from the sender's balance before adding it to the recipient's balance. This means that the sender's balance will be reduced before the transfer is completed, which can lead to a loss of tokens."

However, there is no access control mechanism in place to ensure that only the owner of the tokens can call this function. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential token theft."
