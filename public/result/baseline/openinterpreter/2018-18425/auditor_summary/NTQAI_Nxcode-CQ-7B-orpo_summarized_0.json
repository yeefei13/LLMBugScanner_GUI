However, the address of the token contract is directly passed to the AltcoinToken constructor. This can lead to a potential reentrancy attack if the AltcoinToken contract allows the owner to change the implementation of the token contract."

The randomness is based on the value of _amount, which can be influenced by an attacker. This can lead to potential attacks where an attacker can manipulate the value of _amount to gain an unfair advantage."

However, the access control is implemented using the onlyOwner modifier, which means that only the owner can call this function.
