Based on the provided smart contract code, there are several vulnerabilities that can be identified. Here are the five most severe vulnerabilities:

1. Integer Overflow:
   - Function Name: `_transfer`
   - Vulnerability: The function `_transfer` allows for the transfer of tokens between addresses, but it does not check for integer overflow. If the `_value` parameter is greater than the available balance of the `_from` address, it can result in an integer overflow and cause the contract to behave unexpectedly.
   - Function Code:
     ```
     function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {
         require (_to != 0x0);                               
         require (balanceOf[_from] > _value);                
         require (balanceOf[_to] + _value > balanceOf[_to]); 
         balanceOf[_from] -= _value;                         
         balanceOf[_to] += _value;                            
         Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
     }
     ```
   - Reason: The function does not check if the sum of `_value` and the current balance of `_to` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the `uint256` data type. If the sum exceeds the maximum value, it can result in an integer overflow, leading to incorrect token balances and potentially causing the contract to behave unexpectedly.

2. Wrong Logic:
   - Function Name: `transferFrom`
   - Vulnerability: The `transferFrom` function allows for the transfer of tokens from one address to another, but it does not check if the `_value` parameter is less than the allowance of the `_from` address. If the `_value` parameter is greater than the allowance, it can result in the transfer of more tokens than allowed.
   - Function Code:
     ```
     function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {
         require (_value < allowance[_from][msg.sender]);     
         allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
         _transfer(_from, _to, _value);
         return true;
     }
     ```
   - Reason: The function does not check if the `_value` parameter is less than the allowance of the `_from` address. If the `_value` parameter is greater than the allowance, it can result in the transfer of more tokens than allowed, which can be exploited by attackers to drain the tokens from the contract.

3. Bad Randomness:
   - Function Name: `setPrices`
   - Vulnerability: The `setPrices` function allows for the setting of the sell and buy prices for the token. However, it does not implement any randomness or security measures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the prices.
   - Function Code:
     ```
     function setPrices(uint256 newSellPrice, uint256 newBuyPrice) onlyOwner {
         sellPrice = newSellPrice;
         buyPrice = newBuyPrice;
     }
     ```
   - Reason: The function does not implement any randomness or security measures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the prices. Attackers can manipulate the prices to gain an unfair advantage.

4. Access Control:
   - Function Name: `mintToken`
   - Vulnerability: The `mintToken` function allows for the minting of new tokens by the owner. However, it does not implement any access control mechanisms to ensure that only the owner can call this function.
   - Function Code:
     ```
     function mintToken(address target, uint256 mintedAmount) onlyOwner {
         balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;
         totalSupply += mintedAmount;
         Transfer(0, this, mintedAmount);
         Transfer(this, target, mintedAmount);
     }
     ```
   - Reason: The function does not implement any access control mechanisms to ensure that only the owner can call this function. Attackers can call this function to mint new tokens without proper authorization, potentially leading to unauthorized token distribution.

5. Typo Constructor:
   - Function Name: `CTB`
   - Vulnerability: The constructor of the `CTB` contract has a typo in the function name. The function name should be `CTB` instead of `CTb`.
   - Function Code:
     ```
     function CTB(
         uint256 initialSupply,
         string tokenName,
         uint8 decimalUnits,
         string tokenSymbol
     ) token (initialSupply, tokenName, decimalUnits, tokenSymbol) {}
     ```
   - Reason: The constructor has a typo in the function name, which can lead to confusion and potential errors in the contract's usage.

Please note that these vulnerabilities are exploitable in real-world scenarios and can be used by attackers to manipulate the contract's behavior and steal tokens. It is important to address these vulnerabilities by implementing appropriate security measures and updates to the smart contract code.
