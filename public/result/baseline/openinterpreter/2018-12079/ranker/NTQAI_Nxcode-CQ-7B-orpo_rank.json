      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The integer overflow vulnerability arises when the sum of `balanceOf[_to]` and `_value` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the `uint256` data type. This can lead to incorrect token balances and potential loss of funds.",

      "criticism": "The wrong logic in the `transferFrom` function can lead to incorrect token balances and potential loss of funds. If the `_value` parameter is greater than the sender's balance, it can result in a negative balance for the sender.",
