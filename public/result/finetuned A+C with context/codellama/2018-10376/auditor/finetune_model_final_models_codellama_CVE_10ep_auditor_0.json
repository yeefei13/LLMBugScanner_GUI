### Summary:

The following smart contracts have an integer overflow issue in the following function:

* distribute
* transferFrom
* toOwner
* mintToken
* PayWinner

These smart contracts have a predictable randomness issue in the following function:

* mintToken

These smart contracts have a DoS attack issue in the following function:

* PayWinner

### Solution:

The following smart contracts have an integer overflow issue in the following function:

* distribute
* transferFrom
* toOwner
* mintToken
* PayWinner

These smart contracts have a predictable randomness issue in the following function:

* mintToken

These smart contracts have a DoS attack issue in the following function:

* PayWinner

### Attack Scenario:

The attacker sets an arbitrary value for an arbitrary user in the mintToken function, causing an integer overflow and a loss of assets for the attacker.

The attacker sets an arbitrary value for an arbitrary user in the PayWinner function, causing a predictable DoS attack and a loss of assets for the attacker.

### Analysis:

The distribute function allows an attacker to set an arbitrary value for an arbitrary user, causing an integer overflow and a loss of assets for the attacker.

The transferFrom function has an incorrect logic in the line `totalAmount += _amounts[a];`. 
If the sum exceeds the maximum value representable by the `uint` type (`2^256 - 1`), it causes an integer overflow. 
This bypasses the subsequent `require` check, leading to unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies.

The toOwner function has an outdated naming convention, allowing an attacker to claim ownership and funds.

The mintToken function has a predictable randomness issue, allowing an attacker to set an arbitrary value for an arbitrary user, causing a loss of assets for the attacker.

The PayWinner function has a predictable DoS attack issue, allowing an attacker to set an arbitrary value for an arbitrary user, causing a loss of assets for the attacker.
