### Solution:
The issue is caused by an integer overflow in the following line: `totalAmount += _amounts[a];`. 
This allows an attacker to set the balance of an arbitrary user to any value.
The solution is to add a check for the balance of the contract owner, ensuring that the owner cannot set the balance of an arbitrary user to any value.
```
### Bad Randomness:
The PayWinner function has bad randomness, allowing an attacker to exploit the lottery system.
The attacker can set the balance of an arbitrary user to any value, allowing them to lock up the lottery system.
### Solution:
The attacker can set the balance of an arbitrary user to any value, allowing them to lock up the lottery system.
The solution is to add a check for the balance of the contract owner, ensuring that the owner cannot set the balance of an arbitrary user to any value.
