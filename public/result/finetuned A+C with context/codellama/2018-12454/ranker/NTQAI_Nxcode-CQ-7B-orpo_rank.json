    "vulnerability": "Denial of Service",
    "criticism": "The contract is susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the use of a fixed-size array for storing guesses. If the number of guesses exceeds the array size (1000 in this case), new guesses will be rejected, leading to a DoS condition for users attempting to participate in the lottery. This is particularly problematic if the attacker can consistently cause the number of guesses to reach the array limit.",
    "correctness": 5,
    "severity": 8,
    "profitability": 4,
    "solution": "To address this, the contract should dynamically handle the storage of guesses, such as using a mapping instead of a fixed-size array, which would allow for a virtually unlimited number of guesses. This would prevent a DoS scenario where new participants cannot join the lottery once the array is full."
