      "vulnerability": "Denial of Service",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability labeled 'Denial of Service' is related to the 'mintToken' function due to the potential for the contract to become unusable if the 'totalSupply' overflows. This is a severe issue as it can prevent users from interacting with the contract, leading to a significant loss of functionality. The presence of this vulnerability is justified by the risk of overflow.",

      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability labeled 'Integer Overflow' is present in the 'mintToken' function due to an incorrect calculation of 'totalSupply'. This can lead to an overflow of the 'totalSupply' variable, which can cause the contract to malfunction or be exploited. The reasoning provided is accurate, as the unchecked addition of 'mintedAmount' to 'totalSupply' without any overflow checks can lead to this issue.",

    },

      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability labeled 'Wrong Logic' is also present in the 'mintToken' function, stemming from the same issue as the 'Integer Overflow' vulnerability. The incorrect calculation of 'totalSupply' due to the unchecked addition of 'mintedAmount' can lead to logical errors in the contract's functioning. This is a critical issue as it affects the core logic of the contract.",
