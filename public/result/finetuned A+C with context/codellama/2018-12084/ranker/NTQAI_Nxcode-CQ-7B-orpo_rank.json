      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability exists in the line `totalAmount += _amounts[a];`. This line is susceptible to integer overflow because it does not check for the maximum value that `totalAmount` can hold. An attacker could exploit this by providing a large value for `_amounts[a]`, causing an overflow that results in `totalAmount` being set to a much lower value than expected. This can lead to significant financial loss and can be exploited to manipulate user balances.",

Specifically, the refund logic is tied to state updates, which can be abused to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by manipulating the state to prevent refunds.",
