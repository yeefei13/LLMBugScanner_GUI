            "description": "The vulnerability exists in the line `totalAmount += _amounts[a];`. It allows an attacker to create an arbitrary amount of tokens and transfer them to any user, including the owner. The attacker can also set the balance of an arbitrary user to any value. The most severe impact of this vulnerability is a complete loss of assets for the attacker, including the owner's assets. The attackers can also steal assets, including the owner's assets, through the use of a smart contract auditor. The attackers can also manipulate the balance of an arbitrary user, including the owner's assets, through the use of a smart contract auditor.
