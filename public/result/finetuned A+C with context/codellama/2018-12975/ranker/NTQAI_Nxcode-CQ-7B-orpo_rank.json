{"output_list": [{"function_name": "CryptoSagaHero", "auditor_idx": 0, "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow", "criticism": "The vulnerability arises from the unchecked addition of uint256 values in functions such as `mint`, `addExp`, and potentially others. This can lead to an integer overflow, allowing an attacker to manipulate the balance of tokens or experience points beyond the expected range, leading to unpredictable behavior or exploitative situations.", "correctness": 7, "severity": 8, "profitability": 6}]}
