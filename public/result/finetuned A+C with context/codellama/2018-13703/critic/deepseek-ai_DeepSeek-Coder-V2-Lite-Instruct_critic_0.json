            "criticism": "The function 'mintToken' contains an integer overflow vulnerability. The calculation of 'totalTokenToMint' is done without considering the potential overflow, which can lead to an unauthorized increase in the total supply of tokens. This is a significant issue as it allows attackers to mint an unlimited number of tokens, potentially leading to the complete devaluation of the token's value.",

            "vulnerability": "Bad Randomness",
            "criticism": "The function 'mintToken' uses a predictable and deterministic approach for generating randomness, which is a major security flaw. This allows attackers to predict the outcome of the minting process, making it easier for them to exploit the system. The lack of randomness in the minting process significantly weakens the security of the token.",

            "vulnerability": "Typo Constructor",
            "criticism": "There is a typo in the constructor function name, which is likely a mistake. This typo allows the contract to be initialized with incorrect parameters, potentially leading to unintended behavior. While the impact might not be as severe as other vulnerabilities, it still indicates a lack of attention to detail and could lead to issues in the future.",
