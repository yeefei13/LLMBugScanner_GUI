      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability is likely due to the unchecked addition of `_amounts[a]` to `totalAmount` without ensuring that the result does not cause an integer overflow. This can lead to unauthorized access to attacker's assets as the attacker can manipulate the `_amounts` array to overflow the `totalAmount` variable, leading to a denial of service or unauthorized access to funds.",

      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability is evident in the logic used during the transferFrom function, where the function does not properly check for integer overflows. This can lead to unauthorized access to attacker's assets as the attacker can manipulate the transfer amount to cause an overflow, leading to a denial of service or unauthorized access to funds.",
