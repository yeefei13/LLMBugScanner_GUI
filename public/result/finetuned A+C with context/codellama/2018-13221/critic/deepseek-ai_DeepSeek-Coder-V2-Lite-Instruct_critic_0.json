            "criticism": "The code contains multiple instances of 'Integer Overflow' vulnerabilities, primarily in the line `totalAmount += _amounts[a];`. The use of unchecked arithmetic operations without overflow checks can lead to significant security issues. The severity is high due to the potential for unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies. The profitability is moderate as it requires specific conditions to exploit, but the impact is widespread.",
