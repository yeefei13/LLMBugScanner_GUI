    "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
    "criticism": "The `mintToken` function in the provided code snippet is vulnerable to an integer overflow. This can lead to an attacker minting an arbitrary large number of tokens, effectively draining the token supply. The code does not include any checks to prevent overflow, making it susceptible to this attack. The severity is high due to the potential for unlimited token creation, which can lead to significant financial loss and undermine the trust in the token.",

    "recommendation": "Consider using SafeMath library to ensure arithmetic operations are checked for overflows."
