{"output_list": [{"function_name": "distribute", "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow", "description": "The vulnerability exists in the line `totalAmount += _amounts[a];`. 
The integer overflow in the calculation allows unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies.
This bypasses the subsequent `require` check, leading to unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies.
