      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability in the `distribute` function arises from the unchecked addition of `_amounts[a]` to `totalAmount` in the line `totalAmount += _amounts[a];`. This can lead to an integer overflow, where the addition of two numbers results in a number that is smaller than expected. This can be exploited to bypass the subsequent `require` checks, allowing unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies. The use of the SafeMath library or proper checks can prevent this vulnerability.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 3
    }
