However, the reasoning provided in the vulnerabilities suggests that this line is susceptible to integer overflow, which could lead to significant security issues. The lack of explicit checks or safeguards against overflow makes this a critical vulnerability.",

The reasoning provided for the overflow vulnerability also applies to the logic error, as both are related to the handling of token amounts.
