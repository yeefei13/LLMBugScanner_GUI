            "description": "The vulnerability exists in the line `totalAmount += _amounts[a];`. The following integer overflow occurs: `totalAmount = 2**256 - 1`. The attack can be prevented by ensuring that the `totalAmount` is less than `2**256 - 1`. The attack can be prevented by ensuring that the `totalAmount` is greater than `0`. The attack can be prevented by using a safe multiplication function, such as `totalAmount = _amounts[a] * _amounts[b];`. The attack can be prevented by using a checked loop, such as `require(_amounts[a] > 0 && _amounts[b] > 0);`.
