            "criticism": "The function 'PayWinner' relies on predictable winner selection without using secure randomness. This can be exploited by attackers to predict and target specific winners, leading to potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The lack of secure randomness makes it easier for attackers to manipulate the outcome, compromising the integrity and fairness of the system.",

            "criticism": "The 'distribute' function in the MAVash contract is susceptible to integer overflow, which can lead to unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit the overflow to gain control over tokens that they should not be able to access. The severity of this vulnerability is high due to the potential for significant financial loss and the ease with which it can be exploited.",
