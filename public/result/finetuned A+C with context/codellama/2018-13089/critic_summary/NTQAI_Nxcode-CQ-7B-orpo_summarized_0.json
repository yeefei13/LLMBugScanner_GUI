            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "criticism": "The vulnerability arises from the use of unchecked arithmetic operations, which can lead to integer overflow. In the line `uint ownerTax = 6 * totalBounty / 100;`, if `totalBounty` is sufficiently large, the multiplication can overflow, allowing an attacker to manipulate the tax calculation. This is a severe issue as it can lead to significant financial loss to the contract owner.",

This allows an attacker to exploit the fixed calculation to set the owner's tax to any value, leading to potential financial loss. This is a critical vulnerability that needs immediate attention.",

            "criticism": "The vulnerability is similar to the 'Integer Overflow' in the `mintToken` function. The unchecked addition `totalSupply += mintedAmount;` can lead to a denial of service if `mintedAmount` is very large, causing an overflow that locks up the token supply. This is a significant issue as it can prevent users from acquiring new tokens.",
