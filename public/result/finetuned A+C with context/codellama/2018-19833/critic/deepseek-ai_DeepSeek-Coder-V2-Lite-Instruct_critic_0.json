            "criticism": "The identified vulnerability is a classic example of integer overflow. The code does not properly check for the upper limit of the `totalAmount` variable when summing up amounts. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can manipulate the `_amounts` array to overflow the `totalAmount` variable, resulting in a significant loss of funds. The reasoning provided is accurate, as this is a critical issue that can lead to severe consequences.",

            "recommendation": "Consider implementing a safe math library or using uint128 instead of uint256 for `totalAmount` if the maximum possible sum of amounts is known and limited to avoid overflow."
