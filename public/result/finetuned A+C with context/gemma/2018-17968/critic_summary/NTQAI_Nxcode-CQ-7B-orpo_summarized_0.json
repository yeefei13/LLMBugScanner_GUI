            "criticism": "The function 'distributeFunds' uses division to calculate 'balanceToDistribute', which could lead to an integer overflow if 'room.balance' is large. This vulnerability is significant because it could allow an attacker to manipulate the division operation to cause an overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service or unauthorized access to funds. The use of SafeMath is appropriate for addition and subtraction, but not for division, which could be bypassed by an attacker to exploit the overflow.",

            "criticism": "Similar to 'distributeFunds', the function 'refundPlayersInRoom' uses division to calculate 'balanceToRefund', which could lead to an integer overflow. This vulnerability is concerning because it affects the ability to refund players correctly, which is a critical function in the contract. The lack of SafeMath usage here is a significant issue, as it leaves the contract vulnerable to overflows that could be exploited to manipulate balances.",

This vulnerability is severe because it directly affects the financial integrity of the contract, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the balance and gain unauthorized access to funds. The absence of SafeMath usage in this context is critical, as it leaves the contract vulnerable to overflows that could be exploited.",
