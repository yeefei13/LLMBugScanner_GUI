### Analysis:
The Integer Overflow in the distribute function occurs when the total amount of tokens to distribute is greater than the total amount of tokens in the contract. This causes the balance of the contract to be completely wiped out. The Integer Overflow in the PayWinner function occurs when the random value used to determine the winner's balance is not in the range of the total balance of the contract. This results in the winner's balance being completely wiped out. The Integer Overflow in the MorphToken function occurs when the total amount of tokens to be created is greater than the total amount of tokens in the contract. Again, this causes the balance of the contract to be completely wiped out. 
The impact of these vulnerabilities is financial losses, incorrect token distributions, and reputational damage. 
To mitigate these vulnerabilities, you can use the following approaches: 
1. Use safe math operations to avoid integer overflow. 
2. Implement a check to ensure that the total amount of tokens to distribute is not greater than the total amount of tokens in the contract.
3. Implement a random logic to ensure that the winner's balance is within the range of the total balance of the contract.
4. Use a safe, deterministic algorithm to determine the winner, reducing the chance of the random guess being selected.
5. Ensure that the contract is fully funded before going into production.
6. Use an allowance pool to allow the owner to distribute tokens to a list of beneficiaries without the need to transfer the entire balance of the contract.
7. Restrict the owner's actions to only the permitted set of functions.
8. Use a Timelock, ICO, or similar approaches to allow the owner to recover their funds.
9. Use a balance-checking, always-updating balance-check function to ensure that the contract never goes completely.  
10. Use a spendable token with a set owner and set spend limit to restrict the spend of the token.
11. Use a zero-fee token to eliminate the need for the owner to pay the developer.
12. Use a pay-as-you-go token to allow the owner to only pay when they use the token.
13. Use a lock-and-release token to allow the owner to recover their funds only after a specified time period.
14. Use a set owner with a set balance to control the distribution of tokens.
15. Use a minimum balance threshold to prevent the contract from going completely.
16. Use a balance-check on the set of addresses to be sent, in case they are set incorrectly.
17. Use a fail-safe, selfdestruct, time-bomb function to destroy the contract if it reaches its end without the owner flushing the funds.
18. Use a separate, stand-alone, non-interactive contract to handle the user's tokens.
19. Use a more flexible, non-hardcoded approach to allow the owner to set the balance of each user.
20. Use a 'will-pay-me' method to allow the owner to delay the payment of a specified amount of tokens.
