            "criticism": "The vulnerability labeled 'Bad Randomness' in the MorphToken function is valid. The function relies on `msg.sender` as a source of randomness, which is inherently flawed. This can lead to predictable outcomes, allowing attackers to exploit the randomness for their advantage, potentially leading to significant token gains. The use of `msg.sender` as a source of randomness is not secure and can be manipulated by attackers.",
