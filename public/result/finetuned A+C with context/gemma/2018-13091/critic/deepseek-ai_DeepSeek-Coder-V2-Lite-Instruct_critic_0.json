            "criticism": "The vulnerability arises because the code does not properly check for overflow when minting new tokens. This allows the owner to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens, which can lead to significant loss of value and disrupt the token's economic balance. The use of SafeMath library is partially correct but the overflow condition is not fully enforced.",

            "criticism": "Similar to the mintToken function, the burn function does not check for overflow when reducing the total supply. This could allow the owner to burn an arbitrary amount of tokens, potentially leading to system instability and financial loss. The use of SafeMath is missing for this specific operation.",

            "criticism": "The burnFrom function also fails to check if the caller has the allowance to burn tokens on behalf of another user.
