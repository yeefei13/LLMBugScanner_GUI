{"output_list": [{"function_name": "mintTokens", "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow", "reason": "Integer overflow in mintTokens function allows unauthorized increase of total supply of the digital assets.", "impact": "Financial Loss, Wrong Logic, Bad Randomness, Access Control, Token Devalue"}]}
<hr>
### Analysis: The vulnerability in the mintTokens function arises from the fact that the balance of the owner (msg.sender) is not checked before performing the transaction. This allows unauthorized users to increase the total supply of the digital assets. The vulnerability is also expressed as "Integer Overflow". 
The impact of this vulnerability is twofold. Firstly, it creates financial loss as the owner's balance is not checked, allowing unauthorized users to perform the transaction. Secondly, it generates bad randomness, potentially impacting the trust of the users. 
To fix this vulnerability, the balance of the owner should be checked before performing the transaction. Additionally, the function should only allow authorized users to perform the transaction. 
The fixed code would look like this:
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;
contract Play2LivePromo {
    address public owner;
    string public constant name  = "Level Up Coin Diamond | play2live.io";
    string public constant symbol = "LUCD";
    uint8 public constant decimals = 18;
    uint public totalSupply = 0; 
    uint256 promoValue = 777 * 1e18;
    mapping(address => uint) balances;
    mapping(address => mapping (address => uint)) allowed;
    event Transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 amount); 
    function Play2LivePromo() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    function setPromo(uint256 _newValue) external onlyOwner {
        promoValue = _newValue;
    }
    function balanceOf(address _investor) public constant returns(uint256) {
        return balances[_investor];
    }
    function mintTokens(address _investor) external onlyOwner {
        balances[_investor] +=  promoValue;
        totalSupply += promoValue;
        Transfer(0x0, _investor, promoValue);
    }
    function transfer(address _to, uint _amount) public returns (bool) {
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        allowed[msg.sender][msg.sender] -= _amount;
        balances[_to] -= _amount;
        Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
        return true;

        Transfer(_from, _to, _amount);
        return true;
    }
    function approve(address _spender, uint _amount) public returns (bool) {
        require((_amount == 0) || (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == 0));
        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _amount;
        Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _amount);
