            "reason": "The morphToken function relies on the owner's guess of the target's identity, allowing attackers to change the morphToken contract without the owner's knowledge. This allows attackers to create arbitrary user-guessing contracts, which can be used to create the owner's identity, granting the attacker full control over the contract and the user's funds."
