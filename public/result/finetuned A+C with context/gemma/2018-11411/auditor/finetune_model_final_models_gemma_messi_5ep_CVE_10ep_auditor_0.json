**Note**: This is a complete example and the individual parts are interchangeable. 
The vulnerability in the distribute function allows unauthorized users to set the balance of an arbitrary user. 
The transferFrom function has a vulnerability allowing the attacker to change the balance of the victim by arbitrary logic. 
The mintToken function has an undefined owner, allowing unauthorized users to access the contract and change the balance of the owner. 
The payWinner function and getEthBalance function have a common vulnerability that allows unauthorized users to access personal or financial information.
