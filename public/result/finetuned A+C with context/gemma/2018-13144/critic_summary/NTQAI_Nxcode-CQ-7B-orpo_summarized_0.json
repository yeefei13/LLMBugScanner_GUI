            "criticism": "The function 'MorphToken' relies on an undefined variable '_random', which introduces unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. This lack of randomness control can lead to exploitative scenarios where attackers can manipulate the outcome based on predictable inputs. The absence of a proper random number generator or seed mechanism makes the function unreliable and unsafe.",

The provided code snippet does not contain any arithmetic operations that could lead to an integer overflow. The reasoning provided seems to be a misunderstanding of the code's functionality. This misinterpretation could lead to a false sense of security and potentially overlook other critical vulnerabilities.",
