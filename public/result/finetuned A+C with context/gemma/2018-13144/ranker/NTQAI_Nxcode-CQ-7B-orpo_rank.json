    "criticism": "The function 'MorphToken' relies on an undefined variable '_random', which introduces unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. This lack of randomness control can lead to exploitative scenarios where attackers can manipulate the outcome based on predictable inputs. The absence of a proper random number generator or seed mechanism makes the function unreliable and unsafe.",
