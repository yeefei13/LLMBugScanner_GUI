### Explanation of Scores:
- **Correctness**: This score reflects how accurately the typo is represented in the code. A score of 1 indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or neglect, while a score of 9 indicates a very precise and detailed error.
- **Severity**: This score assesses the potential impact of the typo on the functionality and security of the contract. A high score indicates a significant risk to the contract's operation.
- **Profitability**: This score considers the effort and resources required to correct the typo. A high score indicates that correcting the typo would be a complex and costly process.
