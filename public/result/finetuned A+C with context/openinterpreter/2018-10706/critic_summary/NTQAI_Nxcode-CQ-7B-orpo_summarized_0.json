This can lead to token devaluation if a user attempts to transfer more tokens than they possess. This is a significant vulnerability as it directly impacts the integrity and value of the token.",

This can lead to predictable random numbers, which is a significant issue as randomness is crucial in many applications, including gambling, lotteries, and secure random number generation for cryptographic purposes. This vulnerability can lead to predictable outcomes and potentially compromised security.",
