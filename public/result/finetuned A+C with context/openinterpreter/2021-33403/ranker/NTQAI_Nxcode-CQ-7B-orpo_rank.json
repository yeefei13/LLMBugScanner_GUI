Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "distribute",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The 'distribute' function does not explicitly mention any code that could lead to integer overflow. The vulnerability is inferred from the general context of token distribution, but without specific code to analyze, it's challenging to assign a high score. The reasoning seems to focus on the potential for large amounts of tokens to be minted, which could be a valid concern but is not directly tied to any overflow in the function provided.",
      "correctness": 3,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 5
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The 'transferFrom' function contains a critical flaw in the logic that checks the allowance. The condition `if (balances[_from] >= _amount && allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _amount && _amount > 0 && balances[_to] + _amount > balances[_to])` is incorrect. The check `balances[_to] + _amount > balances[_to]` is always true because `_amount` is positive and `balances[_to]` cannot be negative. This flaw allows unauthorized transfers, which is a severe vulnerability.",
      "correctness": 2,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 8
    }
  ]
}
```

The output only includes the vulnerabilities with a severity greater than 7.
