The vulnerability description refers to an arbitrary increase of token supply, which is typically associated with minting tokens. Since the function does not exist, the vulnerability cannot be assessed in this context. The criticism is based on the assumption that the function should exist and manage token supply, which is a critical aspect of ERC20 token standards. The absence of this function makes it impossible to assess the vulnerability's correctness, severity, and profitability.",
