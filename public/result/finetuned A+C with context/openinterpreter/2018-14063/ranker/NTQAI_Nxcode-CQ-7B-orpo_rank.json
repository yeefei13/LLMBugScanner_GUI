This can lead to incorrect balance calculations, potentially causing loss of funds. The check `require(balances[_to] + _amount > balances[_to]);` is flawed because it assumes that the addition will not overflow, which is not guaranteed in Solidity 0.4.x where underflows and overflows are not checked. This should be replaced with a proper overflow check.",
