    "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
    "criticism": "The vulnerability arises due to the lack of a check to ensure that the subtraction of the mined amount from `miningStorage` results in a value less than zero. This could lead to an integer overflow, where `miningStorage` becomes negative. This is a critical issue because it can lead to incorrect accounting and potential exploits.",
    "correctness": 6,
    "severity": 9,
    "profitability": 5,
    "recommendation": "Implement a check to ensure that the subtraction of the mined amount from `miningStorage` does not result in a negative value."
