### Explanation of Scores:
- **Correctness**: This score reflects how well the vulnerability is addressed in the code. A score of 0 means the vulnerability is not addressed at all, while a score of 9 means the vulnerability is fully addressed.
- **Severity**: This score reflects the potential impact of the vulnerability. A score of 0 means the vulnerability has minimal impact, while a score of 9 means the vulnerability could lead to catastrophic consequences.
- **Profitability**: This score reflects the economic incentive for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability. A score of 0 means there is no incentive, while a score of 9 means the vulnerability is highly lucrative for an attacker.

### Scoring Details:
- **totalSupply**: The variable is not constant, making it mutable and susceptible to overflow. The score is 7 for correctness because it should be immutable. The severity and profitability are moderate because while it's a significant vulnerability, it's not immediately exploitable without additional code changes.
- **balanceOf, transfer, transferFrom, approve**: These functions lack checks that could prevent overflow. The scores are 6 for correctness because checks should be added. The severity is high because these are fundamental functions in a token contract. Profitability is moderate because while they are exploitable, they might not be immediately used for malicious purposes without additional context.
