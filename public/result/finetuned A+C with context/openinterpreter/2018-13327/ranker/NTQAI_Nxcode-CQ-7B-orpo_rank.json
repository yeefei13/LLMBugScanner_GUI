      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transfer function does not check for integer overflow, which can lead to negative balances. This is a critical vulnerability as it can lead to loss of funds and potentially crash the contract if not handled properly.",
      "correctness": 2,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "Similar to the transfer function, this function also does not check for integer overflow, posing a significant risk to the contract's integrity. The severity is high due to the potential for significant financial loss.",
      "correctness": 2,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 7
    }
