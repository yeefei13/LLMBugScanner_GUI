This can lead to an integer overflow, allowing the owner to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens, which can cause the contract's state to become inconsistent, particularly with respect to the total supply of tokens. This vulnerability is severe because it can lead to the loss of funds and manipulation of the token distribution.",
