      "function_name": "mintToken",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability arises due to the lack of proper overflow checks in the `mintToken` function, which can lead to an unauthorized increase in token balances. This can result in significant token value decreases and financial losses for token holders. The severity is high due to the direct impact on the token's economic model.",

      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The `sell` function is vulnerable to integer overflow when calculating the amount to send back to the seller. This can be exploited to manipulate the sale price and steal funds from the contract. The severity is high due to the direct financial impact on users and the potential for large-scale theft.",

      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The `transferFrom` function does not validate the target address as a contract, which can lead to unintended behavior and unauthorized transfers. This is a critical issue as it breaches the trust model of the token contract.",

      "vulnerability": "Typo Constructor",
      "criticism": "The typo in the function name `ToOwner` unintentionally exposes the function as public, which could lead to unauthorized access and potential misuse. The severity is moderate due to the impact on contract accessibility control.",
