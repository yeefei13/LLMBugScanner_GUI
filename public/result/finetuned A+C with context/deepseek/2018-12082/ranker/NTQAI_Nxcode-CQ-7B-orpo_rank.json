      "vulnerability": "Typo Constructor",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability is due to a typo in the function name `MorphToken`, which unintentionally exposes the constructor function, allowing any user to claim ownership and funds, compromising the security and control of the token.",

      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability arises due to the lack of overflow checks in the `mintToken` function, allowing the owner to mint an arbitrary large amount of tokens, potentially leading to financial loss and manipulation of the token's supply.",
