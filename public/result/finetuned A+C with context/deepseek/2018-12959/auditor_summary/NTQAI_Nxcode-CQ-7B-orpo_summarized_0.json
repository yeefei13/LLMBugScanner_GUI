            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "reason": "The 'distribute' function has an integer overflow vulnerability in the line 'totalAmount += _amounts[a];'. If the sum exceeds the maximum value representable by the 'uint' type, it causes an overflow, bypassing the subsequent 'require' check and leading to unauthorized deductions and logical inconsistencies."

            "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
            "reason": "The 'claimThrone' function has a wrong logic vulnerability where the refund logic is improperly tied to state updates, enabling a DoS (Denial of Service) attack. An attacker can make the contract unusable by repeatedly calling the function with a large value, causing the contract to become inaccessible."
