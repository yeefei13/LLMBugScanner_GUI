            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "criticism": "The vulnerability arises due to the lack of proper overflow checks in the `mintToken` function. This allows an attacker to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens, which can lead to significant financial loss. The function does not validate the `mintedAmount` parameter, leading to potential overflows. This is a severe issue as it directly impacts the token's supply and value.",

            "criticism": "The `sell` function is susceptible to an integer overflow attack. By setting the `sellPrice` to a very high value, an attacker can cause an overflow when calculating the amount of tokens to be sent, leading to a denial of service. This is a high-severity issue as it can prevent legitimate users from selling their tokens.",
