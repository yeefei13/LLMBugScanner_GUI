            "reason": "The 'distribute' function allows users to distribute tokens to a list of recipients, where the total amount of tokens to be distributed is the sum of an array of token amounts. However, due to a lack of overflow protection, a malicious attacker can exploit this vulnerability to increase the totalAmount variable beyond the maximum value it can hold, causing an integer overflow, and subsequently allowing unauthorized token distribution."

            "reason": "The 'transferFrom' function contains a wrong logic in the condition for verifying sufficient funds and allowances, allowing transfers only when balances or allowances are insufficient. This incorrect logic can be exploited by attackers to enable unauthorized transfers and financial losses."
