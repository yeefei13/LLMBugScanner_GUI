            "criticism": "The vulnerability arises from the lack of overflow checks in the mintToken function. This allows an attacker to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens, leading to a significant deviation from the intended supply and potentially devaluing the token. The severity is high due to the potential for significant financial loss and the ease with which the vulnerability can be exploited.",

This allows unauthorized transfers because the function does not properly handle the transfer logic. The correctness score is low because the logic is fundamentally flawed, leading to incorrect behavior.",

This is a severe vulnerability as it directly impacts the economic stability and value of the token.
