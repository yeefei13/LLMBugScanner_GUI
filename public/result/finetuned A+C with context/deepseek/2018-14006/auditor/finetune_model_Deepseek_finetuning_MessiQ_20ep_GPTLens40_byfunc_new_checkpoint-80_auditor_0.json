            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "reason": "The 'distribute' function allows users to distribute tokens to multiple recipients in a single transaction. The vulnerability arises from the 'totalAmount += _amounts[a];' statement, which does not enforce a maximum limit on the amount of tokens that can be distributed, leading to an integer overflow attack where the 'totalAmount' variable can be set to a very high value."

            "vulnerability": "Token Devalue",
            "reason": "The 'mintToken' function allows the contract owner to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens and assign them to any user account, effectively devaluing the token and allowing the owner to drain funds from the contract."
