This can lead to a situation where an attacker can exploit this to overflow the balance of the sender, leading to a denial of service or unauthorized transfers. The severity is high due to the potential for significant financial loss and the potential for widespread impact if exploited.",

This can be exploited by an attacker to set a very high allowance, leading to potential unauthorized deductions.
