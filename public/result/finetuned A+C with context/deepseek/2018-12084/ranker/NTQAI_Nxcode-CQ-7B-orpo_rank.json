      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability is valid as the `mintToken` function does not include an overflow check when increasing the total supply. This can lead to a significant loss of value if an attacker can manipulate the minted amount.",

      "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
      "criticism": "The vulnerability is significant as the `transfer` function does not check if the `_to` address is not zero, which can result in tokens being transferred to the zero address and effectively being locked in the contract.
