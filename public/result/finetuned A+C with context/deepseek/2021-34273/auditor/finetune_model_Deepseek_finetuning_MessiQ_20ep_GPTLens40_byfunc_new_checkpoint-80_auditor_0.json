            "reason": "The function 'distributeToken' has an integer overflow vulnerability. The issue occurs in the line 'balances[msg.sender] -= _value;' where the subtraction operation can overflow due to the large value of '_value' and the initial large 'totalSupply' of the token, allowing attackers to steal arbitrary tokens."

            "vulnerability": "Wrong Logic",
            "reason": "The function 'transfer' has a wrong logic in the condition 'require(msg.value > balance)'. This condition is intended for a crowdsale contract, not a token transfer function. The incorrect requirement allows attackers to exploit the logic error and transfer tokens without payment."

            "reason": "The function 'mintToken' allows the owner to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens at will, devaluing the token and causing financial loss to token holders. This is a critical vulnerability as it completely removes economic safeguards in the token distribution."
