This is a critical vulnerability because it allows attackers to prevent legitimate users from purchasing tokens by exhausting the contract's Ether balance. The severity is high due to the potential for significant financial loss and disruption to the service.",

This is a significant vulnerability as it allows attackers to exploit the contract's state changes during external calls, potentially leading to unauthorized transfers. The lack of this check significantly weakens the security of the contract.",
