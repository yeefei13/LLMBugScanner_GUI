            "criticism": "The buy function does not check if the contract has enough balance to transfer the requested amount of Ether, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack if the contract does not have sufficient funds. This is a significant vulnerability as it can prevent users from buying tokens as intended.",

            "criticism": "Similar to the buy function, the sell function does not check if the contract has enough balance to transfer the requested amount of Ether to the seller. This can lead to a similar DoS issue and also affects the user experience by preventing successful sales.",

It permanently removes the contract from the blockchain, which can lead to data loss and is irreversible.
