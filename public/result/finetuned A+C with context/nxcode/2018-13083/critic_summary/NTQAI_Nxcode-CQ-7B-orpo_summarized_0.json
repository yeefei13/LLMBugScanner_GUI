This directly contradicts the principle of least privilege, making it impossible to restrict who can perform these actions, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized transactions and asset theft.",

            "criticism": "The contract does not check the return values of several critical functions such as approve, approveAndCall, transferFrom, transfer, burn, burnFrom, and mintToken. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds if these functions fail without any indication, leaving the contract vulnerable to silent failures.",
