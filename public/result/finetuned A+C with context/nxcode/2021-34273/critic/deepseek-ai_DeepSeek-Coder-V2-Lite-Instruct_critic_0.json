### Explanation of Scores:

1. **Correctness (0-9)**:
   - **transfer**: 4 - The function lacks reentrancy guards, which is a significant oversight in handling token transfers.
   - **transferFrom**: 4 - Similar to `transfer`, this function is also missing reentrancy protection.
   - **approve**: 3 - While the function is designed to set allowances, it does not protect against reentrancy, which can lead to abuse.

2. **Severity (0-9)**:
   - **transfer**: 8 - The lack of reentrancy guards can lead to severe financial loss due to potential exploits.
   - **transferFrom**: 8 - This function is more severe because it involves transfers from other users' accounts.
   - **approve**: 7 - Although less severe than the previous two, it can still lead to significant financial loss if exploited.

3. **Profitability (0-9)**:
   - **transfer**: 7 - The potential for financial loss due to reentrancy makes this a lucrative target for attackers.
   - **transferFrom**: 7 - Similar profitability to `transfer` due to the same underlying issue.
   - **approve**: 6 - While less profitable, it can still be exploited for financial gain if combined with other attacks.

These scores reflect the critical nature of the vulnerabilities and the potential for significant financial loss if exploited.
