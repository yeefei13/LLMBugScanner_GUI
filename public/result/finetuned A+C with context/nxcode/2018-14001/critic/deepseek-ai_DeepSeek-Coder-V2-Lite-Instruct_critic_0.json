            "criticism": "The vulnerability arises from the unchecked addition of balances in the `batchTransfer` function, which can lead to an integer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to set any balance of a user's account arbitrarily, leading to a significant loss of funds. The reasoning behind the score is that this vulnerability can be easily exploited and can lead to severe financial losses, making it a high-severity issue.",

If either `_qty` or `_price` is manipulated, it can lead to an integer overflow, allowing an attacker to set the balance of the buyer arbitrarily. This is a high-severity vulnerability due to its potential impact on user funds.",
