If the transfer fails, the function will still continue execution, potentially leading to loss of funds. This is particularly concerning given the presence of other unchecked return value vulnerabilities in the contract, such as in `mintToken`, `buy`, and `sell` functions. The lack of proper error handling can lead to significant financial losses for users.",
