    "function_name": "transfer_tokens_after_ICO",
    "auditor_idx": 0,
    "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
    "criticism": "Similar to 'distribute_100_tokens_to_many', the 'transfer_tokens_after_ICO' function does not include overflow checks when updating balances. This could lead to an attacker manipulating the token distribution.",
    "correctness": 7,
    "severity": 8,
    "profitability": 6,
    "explanation": "This function also fails to prevent integer overflow, which is a significant issue. The severity is high because it affects the integrity of token transfers. The profitability is moderate to high, as it could be used to exploit the contract for personal gain through token manipulation."
