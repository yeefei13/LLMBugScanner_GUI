            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "criticism": "The 'distribute_100_tokens_to_many' function does not properly check for integer overflow before subtracting from the sender's balance. This allows an attacker to overflow the balance and potentially gain unintended tokens.",

            "severity": 9,
            "profitability": 5,
            "explanation": "The function lacks proper overflow checks, which is a critical vulnerability. The severity is high due to the potential for significant financial loss. The profitability is moderate as it requires the attacker to exploit the overflow condition, which might not be straightforward."

            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "criticism": "Similar to 'distribute_100_tokens_to_many', the 'transfer_tokens_after_ICO' function does not include overflow checks when updating balances. This could lead to an attacker manipulating the token distribution.",
            "correctness": 7,

            "profitability": 6,
            "explanation": "This function also fails to prevent integer overflow, which is a significant issue. The severity is high because it affects the integrity of token transfers. The profitability is moderate to high, as it could be used to exploit the contract for personal gain through token manipulation."
