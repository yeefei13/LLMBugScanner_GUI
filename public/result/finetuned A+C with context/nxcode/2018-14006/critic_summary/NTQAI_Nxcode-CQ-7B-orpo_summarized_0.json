            "criticism": "The constructor's name is incorrectly named as 'NGToken', which is the contract's name rather than the constructor function's name. This typo could lead to confusion and potential errors in the code. The constructor should be named correctly to reflect its purpose, which is to initialize the contract's state variables. Scoring this as a high severity issue because it directly affects the functionality and initialization of the contract.",

            "criticism": "The total supply of the token is set to a very high number (200,000,000,000 NGT) without any mechanism to devalue or burn the tokens. This could lead to a significant loss of value for token holders if there is no way to reduce the total supply. The reasoning provided is valid, but the severity is high because the token's value is not protected against potential issues. The profitability score is lower because the immediate impact of this vulnerability is negative, but the potential for exploitation might be limited without additional functionalities.",
