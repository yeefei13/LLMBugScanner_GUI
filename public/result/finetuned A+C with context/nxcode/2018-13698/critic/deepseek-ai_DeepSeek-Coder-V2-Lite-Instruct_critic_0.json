            "criticism": "The function setPromo is intended to be restricted to the contract owner, but it lacks a proper access control check. This allows any caller to update the promoValue, which could lead to unauthorized changes and potentially undermine the integrity of the promoValue. The vulnerability is significant because it directly impacts the contract's state, and the function is not properly secured against unauthorized use.",

            "criticism": "Similar to setPromo, mintTokens is designed to be restricted to the contract owner. However, the function does not verify that the caller is the owner before minting tokens, which exposes the contract to potential abuse. This vulnerability could lead to uncontrolled token issuance, affecting the token's value and the integrity of the token distribution. The lack of access control in this function is a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the proper functioning of the contract.",
