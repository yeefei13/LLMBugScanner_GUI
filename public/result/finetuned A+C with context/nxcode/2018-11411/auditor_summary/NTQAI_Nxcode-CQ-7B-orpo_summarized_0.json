However, it does not check if the recipient's Ether balance is sufficient to cover the transaction fee. This could allow a malicious user to bypass the Ether balance check and transfer FUD tokens without paying the transaction fee."

This could allow any user to withdraw the FUD tokens from the contract, potentially leading to a loss of funds for the contract owner."
