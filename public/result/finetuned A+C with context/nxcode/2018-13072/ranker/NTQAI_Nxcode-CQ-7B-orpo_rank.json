    "vulnerability": "Unchecked Ether Withdrawal",
    "criticism": "The 'withdrawToOwner' function does not check if the Ether withdrawal was successful before transferring the funds to the owner. This could lead to a loss of funds if the transfer fails. The vulnerability arises because the contract relies on the built-in transfer function of Ethereum, which does not provide a way to check for success or failure of the transaction. This is a critical issue as it directly affects the asset management of the contract.",
    "correctness": 6,
    "severity": 9,
    "profitability": 5,
    "recommendation": "Implement a check to ensure the transfer function does not revert and handle any revert reasons appropriately to prevent loss of funds."
