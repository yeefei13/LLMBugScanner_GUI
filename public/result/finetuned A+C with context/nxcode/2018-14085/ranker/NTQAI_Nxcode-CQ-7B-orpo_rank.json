      "criticism": "The function `sweep` does not properly handle the return value of the `transfer` and `send` functions from the `Token` contract. If these calls fail, the function will return false, but this failure is not communicated back to the caller. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds. The severity is high because it can cause silent failures, which are difficult to debug. The profitability is moderate because it only affects the function's ability to communicate failure, not its core logic.",

      "criticism": "The function `sweeperOf` does not properly handle the return value of the `balanceOf` function from the `Token` contract. If the balanceOf call fails, the function will return 0, but this failure is not communicated back to the caller. This can lead to incorrect assumptions about the balance and potential miscalculation of token amounts. The severity is high because it can lead to incorrect results and potential loss of funds.
