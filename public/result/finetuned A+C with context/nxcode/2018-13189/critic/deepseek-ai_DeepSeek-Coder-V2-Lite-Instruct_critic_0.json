This lack of control over the pausing mechanism can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack where the token transfers are indefinitely halted, preventing users from buying tokens during the ICO period.",

This function bypasses the normal token distribution mechanism and can lead to the creation of an unlimited number of tokens, potentially devaluing the token and affecting investor confidence.",
