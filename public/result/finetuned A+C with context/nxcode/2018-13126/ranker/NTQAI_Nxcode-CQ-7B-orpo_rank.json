{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "mint",
      "auditor_idx": 0,
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function `mint` does not include any overflow checks when updating the `totalSupply`. This is a critical vulnerability as it could lead to a denial of service or unexpected behavior if the total supply exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint256`. The severity is high due to the potential for catastrophic consequences.",
      "correctness": 6,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 5
    }
  ]
