            "criticism": "The function `buyTokens` uses integer division to calculate the number of tokens to be minted, which could lead to incorrect results if `_value` is not a multiple of `pricePerToken`. This is a significant vulnerability because it directly affects the token allocation logic, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the token distribution in their favor.",

            "criticism": "The function `mint` does not include any overflow checks when updating the `totalSupply`. This is a critical vulnerability as it could lead to a denial of service or unexpected behavior if the total supply exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint256`. The severity is high due to the potential for catastrophic consequences.",
