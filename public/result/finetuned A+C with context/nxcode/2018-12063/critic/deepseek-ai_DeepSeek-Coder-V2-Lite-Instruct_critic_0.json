            "criticism": "The function `INTToken` has multiple instances of unchecked return values from various ERC20 functions such as `approveAndCall`, `transferFrom`, `transfer`, `burnFrom`, `burn`, `approve`, `_transfer`, `mintToken`, `setPrices`, `sell`, and `buy`. This lack of return value checking can lead to significant vulnerabilities, including unauthorized transfers, loss of funds, and potential contract freezing issues. The severity is high due to the potential for significant financial loss and the widespread impact of these vulnerabilities.",
