      "criticism": "The function `transferProxy` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to its reliance on the `transferAllowed` modifier, which only checks if the transfer is enabled but does not prevent a reentrancy attack that manipulates the state before the transfer function is called. The lack of reentrancy guards such as `locked` status or checks after external calls can lead to exploitation.",

      "vulnerability": "Reentrancy",
      "criticism": "Similar to `transferProxy`, the function `approveProxy` is also vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to its reliance on external calls and the lack of proper state changes after these calls. The reliance on external calls and the lack of proper state changes after these calls can lead to a reentrancy vulnerability.",
